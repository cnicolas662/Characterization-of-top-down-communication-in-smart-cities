  Notes to Editor:To find out more about City Possible visithttps://citypossible.com/ More about Slush.This is how we did itFor the pilot, Mastercard provided aggregated and anonymous merchant transaction data from Q4/2016, Q4/2017 and Q4/2018 via the City Insights platform.This aggregated transaction data provided a proxy foranalysingspending during the event in the Helsinkiregion. It should be notedthat cash and other card transactions making up the remainder of the total spend were not in the scope of the analysis.The metrics in Mastercards City Insights platform are indices derived from aggregated transactions grouped by time period and mapped into a geogrid of 110m*110m cells based on the standard coordinates in the Helsinki Region map.The data in each grid is indexed and compared against Helsinki Region areas average data on 01 Oct 2016.For the purposes of the review, the material was restricted to Helsinki alone.The aggregated data wasanalysedwith Stata and SAS andvisualisedwithHabidatum'splatformhttps://habidatum.com/More about the results:In this pilot, we did not combinethe aggregated merchanttransactionspenddata with any other data set. With more data, a more complete picture and analysis could be created, and thatcould produce even more relevant and useful results for the city.With this approach we were able toanalyse the spending that happens duringSlush. However, analysing the long-term effects of Slush would require more detailed data analysis.Comparing year to yearisdifficult as Slushis held on different weekdays each year.Due to high variation in spending across weekdays, only within-year comparisons are meaningful. Origin country level segments were not available at the time of the pilot so international spending couldnt be specified by nationalities.Contact details for the City of

While the majority of the City of Helsinki Urban Environment Divisions messaging and customer services are handled electronically, services that rely on postal deliveries will be affected by a protracted postal strike.The delivery of invoices to customers who have opted to receive paper invoices will be delayed during the strike. Because of this, invoices issued during the strike will be issued with extended payment terms. Payment reminders will not be issued to customers during the strike.However, rental invoices should still be paid on time based on the relevant rental agreement regardless of whether the tenant has received an invoice (except in the case of a first rental invoice).The strike may delay the issuing of building permits due to the fact that the hearing of neighbours conducted as part of the permit application process is normally carried out by letter. Applicants can speed up the process by handling the hearing themselves using
the hearing form.The delivery of building permit decisions will be delayed if the applicant has not accepted electronic notification. The carrying out of legal cadastral surveys (in the context of the splitting up of a parcel, for example) may also be delayed as postal deliveries cannot be carried out within the normal time frame.The delivery of laminated resident parking permits to customers may be delayed. However, parking inspectors can check parking rights electronically based on registration plates. A parking permit is valid even if it is not displayed on the vehicle as long as the invoice has been paid on time.During the strike, you can also display an expired parking permit on your vehicle  it is valid as long as the new permit has been paid for on time. This applies to all resident parking permits whether they include one or two registration numbers.During the postal strike most of the Urban Environment Divisions mail deliveries will be delayed.

Helsinki and some of Finlands most renowned tech companies launched a talent attraction campaign in September branding Helsinki as the worlds first City as a Service (CaaS). The campaign reframed the value that Helsinki offers to its users (current citizens) and potential demo users (tech professionals looking to relocate) using familiar vocabulary and tone of voice for international tech professionals. The campaign received close to 7,000 applications of tech professionals interested to relocate to Helsinki.Now Helsinki is bringing its potential tech professionals to visit the city. Tech talent from Tel Aviv to New York will experience their potential new hometown Helsinki and its work-life balance during one of the worlds largest startup events, Slush, on 1922 November. The visit is hosted by City of Helsinki along with Supercell, Smartly, Slush, Relex, and MaaS Global (Whim). Finding the best talent in the world is critical for us and other tech companies in Helsinki. It is a great place to live and work, with the best education system, best healthcare, opportunities to families, amazing international companies and happiest people in the world! It is easy to demonstrate that when we bring people here, says Kristo Ovaska, CEO of Smartly.The campaign turned city into a digital product of this decade and pitched Helsinki as a Service, highlighting its multiple perks: Helsinkis 640,000 daily active users, key features such as free world-class education and healthcare. Helsinkis bugs  darkness, snow and the flat skyline  were mentioned as carefully considered features. The citys Mayor Jan Vapaavuori was recruited to act as the CEO of CaaS, encouraging potential demo users to apply for a free demo trip to Helsinki during Europes leading startup event Slush. The stunt was described as clever and engaging by Trendwatching and chosen as their Innovation of the Day. The results speak for themselves. In less than a month Helsinki received close to 7,000 applications from the wished target group of professionals in tech from software engineers, developers, AI researchers etc. Helsinki has all it takes to make you feel like home but the problem was, not too many knew about its beautiful features. To make the world aware of what Helsinki has to offer, the city just needed a little repackaging. says Alexander Pihlainen, CEO of brand company Boubehind the creative concept. This year the Finnish growth companies attracted the most venture capital investments to GDP in Europe, and hundreds of millions of euros in foreign capital have been invested in startups here. With a new approach to branding Helsinki, the city wants to improve the citys image as a place to live. Helsinki is located in one of the world's most secure countries and inhabited by the worlds happiest people. The majority of foreign experts who have settled in Helsinki are satisfied with the quality of life here. The experience of a happy, good life is a combination of tangible  like housing, transportation, jobs and infrastructure  and intangible things. The intangibles  sense of trust and community, equality, closeness to nature  are essential values in building the quality of life, says Jan Vapaavuori, Mayor of Helsinki.Campaign site: www.myhelsinki.fi/caas
Helsinki cycling routes within the programme of enhanced winter maintenance will expand eastward as far as Itkeskus and Laajasalo. Additional funds are proposed for enhanced winter maintenance of pedestrian routes.The total length of routes in the enhanced winter maintenance programme is 40.8 kilometres in the winter season 20192020. Snow-sweeping and de-icing are used for winter maintenance on a 25.2-kilometre stretch of the routes. Enhanced ploughing is used on the 5.9-kilometre waterfront track Rantaratareitti. The new eastern route is maintained using a combination of snow-sweeping and biodegradable potassium formate (9.7 kilometres).The route to the east has been requested in many feedback messages to us, so its magnificent that were now able to provide the extension to the network, says the walking and cycling project manager Antti Takkunen, pleased with the new maintenance services.Snow-sweeping and de-icing combined are an efficient method of keeping bikeways ice-free and safe. The method also improves bikeway safety and usability in spring, as there is no gravel on surfaces to remove. As the use of gravel is reduced, road and street dust  a springtime phenomenon  is also reduced.Snow-sweeping alone without de-icing would not be a sufficient winter maintenance method for bikeways, as bikeway surfaces would easily remain icy and dangerous. Therefore de-icing or some other method to control slipperiness is necessary. In the future, the City will optimize the use of de-icing salts with the help of increasingly accurate traffic conditions reporting in order to avoid excessive use of de-icing salts.New routes on Itvyl and in HerttoniemiLaajasalo will be maintained by snow-sweeping and de-icing, but slipperiness will be controlled with potassium formate instead of salt. Potassium formate works like a salt solution, but it is biodegradable so it does not end up in groundwater. The compound was first tested in winter 20152016, when it was discovered to be as effective as the salt solution. The 2020 budget proposal by the City Board to the City Council includes additional funding for enhanced winter maintenance of key pedestrian routes.The proposal covers the main pedestrian routes in the inner city and paths leading to Metro and local public transport stops. The City Council will next consider the budget proposal at its meeting of 27 November 2019, continuing consideration started at the meeting of 13 November. The proposed funding would enable improvements in the conditions for walking on the busiest pedestrian routes.Read more:Winter cycling routes in the 2019-2020 season (on map)

Additionally, Helsinki has its own campaign theme in support of the message called A worklife worth living, which speaks of the Citys top-level quality of life and the work-life balance that is rooted in functionality.Helsinki is the main partner of Slushs new Ready to Launch event, which focuses on product development.

Amidst global competition for talented professionals, Helsinki takes pride in its mission of becoming the most functional city in the world. The pursuit to provide a good life for its citizens has yielded good results. At Slush 2019, Helsinki takes on the hot topic of work-life balance.In recent years, the city of Helsinki has focused its resources on a specific goal: to create the best urban life for everyone through, for example, developing housing, infrastructure and transportation, as well as creating better jobs. Everything is based on functionality, equality and a sense of community  the very founding values of what is currently one of the fastest growing cities in Europe. Functionality requires innovation, a fact Helsinki has long appreciated. The city is relatively young, and was built literally from nothing. Unhindered by too much tradition, the city cherishes unbiased grassroots experimenting and new ideas by locals and officials alike. With a can-do attitude in its DNA, the citys telling motto is: One HEL of an Impact.The good life in Helsinki is not just talk. Recent years have seen the city racking up outstanding results in global comparisons focused on the quality of life. To mention a few, it ranked #1 in work-life balance in a 40-city survey by the technology company Kisi in social cohesion in IESE Business School Cities in Motion Index, and in equal opportunity in a European-wide comparison conducted by Spotahome. Furthermore, Helsinki received 6th place in Monocles highly esteemed Quality of Life Index, which is no small achievement. Other areas of success in surveys include life-long learning, security and happiness.What is behind all the success? Helsinkis Director of Economic Development, Marja-Leena Rinkineva, has an answer: Its a combination of many things that support each other. Besides concrete things like family-oriented social benefits, remote work opportunities and a first-rate transportation system, theres equality, cohesion, mutual trust, work-life balance and low hierarchies. In short, it means were able to provide security and predictability that enable people to thrive and prosper. According to Rinkineva, this is only the beginning: Theres so much more to do. As a mother of three with a long career, Im a living proof of that Helsinki redefines itself constantly through the actions of its people. Its about small things in our daily lives we seek to improve. We feel that this humble attitude has served us well.In the competition for attracting the best talent, the city of Helsinki draws from its strengths and tackles the problems of todays working life by focusing on work-life balance. Nurturing a healthy balance between work and leisure is essential to our values and we want to get that message across around the world, explains Tommo Koivusalo from Helsinkis NewCo startup services. To turn words into action, Helsinki has designed the City as a Service (CaaS) platform, a service bundle that states its mission is to motivate, guide and help international tech talent to feel at home in the city. As part of showcasing its first demo, Helsinki invited a number of tech pros from around the world for a visit. We want to show that when everything works seamlessly, maintaining a work-life balance becomes so much easier, Koivusalo says.In conjunction with the CaaS project, Helsinki continues its partnership with Slush by launching a new campaign at the event that aims to jump-start discussions among the tech elite and challenge their conceptions of work-related values. To encourage reflection, Helsinki brings artful mirror installations to the centre of the event. On these mirrors, change provoking questions about working life are presented in ways that invite the Slush generation to stop and think about their work-life balance. The same kind of questions are placed on ads all over the city for the duration of Slush. The slogan is Worklife worth living.First, youve got to make people rethink their values and the way they work. Only from recognising the problem can a change be brought about and a healthy and a productive working life be made possible. At the end, its not only about the quantity but more and more about the quality of your work, Koivusalo sums up the idea. Work-life balance is a soft metric. It doesnt really arouse images of hard-working go-getters  the likes of which we see in movies about Wall Street. Is Helsinki really encouraging people to forget their careers? Says Rinkineva: We want to be really clear on this. Helsinki as a city is very pro entrepreneurship. The next leap in productivity comes from innovations. The innovations are brought about in inspiring environments where creative minds can flourish. Our strategy is proving to be successful. A healthy work-life balance means business. And, make no mistake, I mean serious business.More informationYouTube: A Worklife Worth LivingHelsinki City as a Servise (CaaS)Slush 2019: November 2122, HelsinkiHelsinki, the home city of Slush, is the best place in the world to strike a balance between work and time off

What kind of an event city is Helsinki being developed into and what are the goals with the events? How are the event organisers supported? Helsinki wants to be a functional platform and facilitator for diverse and original urban culture. The new Helsinki Road Map for Events and the associated concrete action plan captures the role, goals and development to a level, which supports the successful implementation of the City Strategy.In the Helsinki City Strategy, the so-called eventness is an essential theme in the furthering of vitality and wellbeing, which has been developed with visible results for long. The City is a trustworthy stage for major events and one of the most popular conference destinations in Northern Europe. Of the several urban events that have been developed in Helsinki, many have been picked up around the world.The guidelines of the Road Map for Events were established to ensure that organising events in Helsinki is even easier in the future. There has to be a sufficient number of functional event locations in different parts of the City and sorting out the permits with the City must be uncomplicated.The events hold a significant role in building up Helsinkis agreeability, vitality and attractiveness. The local perspective is strongly visible in the Citys eventness and this is something that the City wants to strengthen in the future as well. At its best, the urban environment is a home to a diverse range of players, both in the large and in the small scale. In the eventness, Helsinki is not only a producer, but a partner and a platform as well. In the future, we want to be even better in all of these roles", notes Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The Helsinki Road Map for Events has three main objectives:1. The events support and realise the City Strategys goals of an international, lively and fascinating City of events in the best possible way.2. The development of the events is based on responsibility.3. The eventness is functional.Helsinki wants to offer the best possible circumstances for urban good life. Urban culture is one essential enabler of good life. It extends Helsinkis originality and attractiveness, increases the cultural understanding and reduces differentiation.Helsinki is committed to responsibility in all of its operations and it is also at the core of the event development. In the Road Map for Events, responsibility is analysed from three perspectives: through environmental responsibility, social responsibility and financial responsibility.A functional event environment that is safe for all is Helsinkis strength and, at the same time, a prerequisite for the development of the event ecosystem. The City wants to be an even better partner for event players.We aim to streamline and systematise the co-operation with event organisers and improve the services aimed at them. In order to achieve this, we must also develop the Citys internal co-ordination and communications, says Project Manager Pivi Munther, who is in charge of the development of the eventness.Due to the urbanisation, the international competition between cities is constantly increasing. Events are used as a way of developing the Citys reputation and brand and developing an attractive local culture. Events hold an increasingly important role in tourism as well, but here, the mega-events are being ousted by local, original events.We want to expand the international profile and attractiveness of the essential Helsinki events in collaboration with event organisers and actively support the creation of new events. The events also offer experimentation platforms for different kinds of innovations, which are developed in co-operation with companies and event visitors, tells Head of Marketing Sanna Forsstrm.The Event Road Map was published to the players in the sector at Helsinkis event seminar on 13 November 2019. In Helsinki, the implementation of the Road Map for Events and the development of eventness is co-ordinated by the Helsinki City Executive Office Communications.The Road Map for Events covers a period of several years. The previous Road Map for Events was published in 2010. The Road Map was established using a vision, which was compiled from 43 interviews, 4 rounds of workshops with around 100 persons and 104 answers to an online survey. The interviews and workshops included participants from within the City organisation, event organisers and public authorities. The online survey was aimed at event organisers.More information (soon also in English)

Services for families with children at Central Library Oodi will be improved when Playground Loru is moved from the first floor to the childrens section balcony on the third floor on Monday 18 November 2019. The amount of pram parking space will also be increased in connection with this change.When services intended for families with children are located close to each other, the library staff and the personnel at Playground Loru will be better able to work together. The balcony on the third floor is also a warmer and cosier space for the littlest customers at Oodi than the first floor.Customer feedback was taken into consideration when making this change by holding two meetings and creating an online survey in the autumn of 2019. All of the 300 responses to the survey were reviewed carefully and used as a basis for improvements to services for those visiting Oodi with prams.The amount of pram parking space will the doubled once the space is moved to the third floor, because people felt that the current space was too small. New pram parking areas will be opened in the southern and northern ends of the first floor. Each parking area will be designated by rugs and a sign that reads P. All pram parking areas will be accompanied by seating for dressing children.Towards the end of the year, the pram parking areas on the first floor will be equipped with stands that can be used to secure the prams using customers own locks. Architects will be designing lockable lockers that can be operated with a library card, near the pram parking areas on the first floor. The lockers can be used to store small bags or childrens winter clothes, for example. The lockers will be installed in Oodi in the spring of 2020.Approximately 9,000 people visit Oodi daily. This number includes seniors, school children, students and tourists, to name a few. There may be hundreds of children of different ages in Oodi at any given time, for example. The library is intended for everyone, and we want to take all user groups into account when designing our spaces.www.oodihelsinki.fi/en/



The movement challenge around the Tlnlahti bay, launched by the City of Helsinki in July, has inspired thousands of walkers and runners. The goal was to complete a number of laps equivalent to the earth's circumference by the end of this year, but those 40,000 kilometres were already completed this week.  It has been great to follow how both individual walkers and runners as well as friend and job groups have grasped the challenge to go around the Tlnlahti bay for the joint goal. School groups have also been actively participating in the collection of kilometres. Thanks to all the participants  you did it! says producers Harri Pulliainen and Marta Tiainen, who guided the walkers and runners at the Helsinki container at the Tlnlahti bay.The completion of the goal means that the City of Helsinki donates 50,000 euros to the clearing of plastic waste from the Baltic Sea. The donation will be handed to the Baltic Sea Challenge that is steered by the cities of Helsinki and Turku and that will use the money to finance speedy experiments. The funding will be used to support innovations that reduce the amount of plastic waste in the Baltic Sea environment, in the archipelago and along the coast. The homecoming of the round-the-world travellers is celebrated at the Helsinki container on the southern shore of the Tlnlahti bay on 4 December at 5-6 PM. The joint last tour around the Tlnlahti bay and the homecoming is celebrated with mulled wine and song.The kilometre counters by the Tlnlahti bay will also be shut down after the homecoming party.

New outdoor workout stairs will be built in many different parts of Helsinki in the next few years. The City of Helsinki Urban Environment Committee approved the Citys workout stairs guideline and workout stairs programme on 3 September 2019. The guideline determines the organization of Helsinki workout stairs services and the quality criteria of the services. The programme, drawn up for 20202030, determines guidelines for the further development of the workout stairs network.Stair running has become an increasingly popular workout and sport. Judging by resident feedback, there is great demand for workout stairs, says planning expert Mikko Malmstrm.Today Helsinki has workout stairs at three sites: on the Malminkartanonhuippu artificial hill in Malminkartano, in Palohein and in Herttoniemi. The Palohein workout stairs are in good condition. The Malminkartano and Herttoniemi workout stairs will be renovated.According to the Helsinki workout stairs programme, nine new stairs sites will be built in the city in the next few years. The new sites are as follows: Alakivenpuisto, the Alppikylnhuippu artificial hill, Ilomenpuisto, Lauttasaari sports park, Mntymki, Pihlajisto, Suutarila, the Talinhuippu artificial hill, and either Vanttikallio or the Vuosaarenhuippu artificial hill in Vuosaari. The site in Vuosaari will be decided as stairs construction is scheduled. All sites should be easily accessible and in the vicinity of sports and recreational trails.The workout stairs construction schedule will be determined in more detail as the City Council makes decisions on the 2020 budget. As a result of budget negotiations, the City Board has decided to propose to the City Council that the construction of nine new workout stairs sites of the workout stairs programme and the renovation of two existing sites be carried out on an accelerated schedule. According to the proposal, site implementation would be commenced as early as in 2020.Read more:
The City Council will discuss the budget for next year and the financial plan for the years 20202022 on Wednesday, 27 November. The budget proposal is based on the agreed final result of the negotiations between the council groups represented in the City Board.The negotiation result can be viewed on the City Board's Agenda.Helsinki City Board approved the 2020 BudgetPress releas October 3rdPreparations
for continuous growth of Helsinki in Mayor Jan Vapaavuoris budget
proposal. Sustainable growth requires
continuous investments in the development of the urban structure. Next year,
Helsinkis investment level exceeds one billion euros, a first in the history
of the City. The
high investment level has been made possible by the responsible and persevering
management of the City economy. The forthcoming economic insecurity
necessitates that Helsinki provides for the sustainability of the growth in the
future as well. Helsinki
assumes its responsibility for balancing the public economy and works to
improve the Citys total productivity, while, at the same time, the Citys
expenditure is moderately increased especially in the services where the
population growth increases the costs most directly. The needs of the growing City is acknowledged in the total dimensions of the operating expenses as well. The total expenditure level in the 2020 budget is about 122 million euros higher than the current year. In 2020, the increase in the operating expenses on the entire City level is around 3 percent from 2019.The overall framework for the operational economy in the City Strategy is jointly defined by the population growth, changes in the level of costs and the 0.5 percent productivity goal. When the budget framework was drafted in spring, the estimated population growth and changes level of costs would have allowed an expenditure growth of 3.47 percent from 2019. All division committee budget proposals were drafted a little above the spring city-level budget framework of 3.47 percent. Based on the proposals of the committees, the combined growth on the city level would be 4.32 percent.The current estimates concerning both the level of costs and the population growth development are lower than in the spring estimates, which means that the strategy-based expenditure growth according to the most recent estimates is 3.03 percent from 2019. The lowered estimates concerning the level of costs and the population growth lower the pressures on the expenditure of the divisions as well.In the 2020 budget, the external operating expenses are 4.598 billion euros. The growth percentages of the budget vary between the divisions within the 3.03-percent limit for the Citys total expenditure.
In the allocation of appropriations, special attention has been paid, in accordance with the City Strategy, to services where the population growth adds to the costs most directly, as well as to the unit cost development at the divisions. The two-year growth in the level of appropriations has also been observed in the allocations (from the 2018 financial statements to the 2020 budget per division). The expenditure growth per division is presented in the table: The operational economy part, income and expenditure per division., (only in Finnish). When it comes to the Urban Environment Division's budget item for buildings and the culture and leisure services, the change in the appropriations for 2020 must be viewed on the operating margin-level.According to the estimate, the population growth is the highest in elderly population groups and this has been taken into account by directing investments towards the budget proposal of the Social services and health care division. The introduction of the new patient data system Apotti in the upcoming year is going to reshape the courses of action and improve the patient safety, but it will also increase the expenditure.Investments are made to further the utilisation of digitalisation and information technology and additional resources are also directed, e.g., towards the improvement of the service standard in the rescue operations. At the City Executive Offices new Strategy Department, a digitalisation unit will be established to focus on the comprehensive development of digitalisation on the City level. In its operations, Helsinki accentuates ecological values and emphasises local actions in the implementation of global responsibility. Searching for ecological solutions in new construction, improving the energy efficiency in buildings and implementing emissions reductions by means of urban planning and traffic solutions are Helsinkis principles of responsible development. In 2020, Helsinki launches the international Helsinki Energy Challenge to find heating solutions that can replace burning coal with as little use of biomass as possible.No changes are proposed to Helsinkis local tax rate for 2020, as the budget proposal is based on a local tax rate of 18.0 percent. The estimated tax revenue for the upcoming year is 2.74 billion euros. This constitutes a 5.4 per cent improvement to the estimate for the current year. However, the 2019 and 2020 increase in the local tax revenue is affected by the tax administration's tax deduction card reform and the reporting problems of the Incomes Register, which move renderings of accounts of taxes from 2019 to 2020. Due to this, the growth percentage for the tax revenue in 2020 frames the accrual of tax revenue in a more positive light than what it is in reality. The increase of the local tax from 2018 to 2020 is estimated at 6.2 percent in total, which better describes the real growth pace of the tax base.The estimated corporate income tax revenue is 600 million euros, or 1.7 percent more than the 2019 estimate. The estimated real estate tax revenue is 283 million euros and the proposed real estate tax rates in Helsinki are kept at the 2019 level. - The estimate for the local tax and corporate income tax revenues includes significant uncertainty factors for the next year and in the long-term for the upcoming years as well. The events in the global economy and the general decline in the market conditions affect Helsinkis economic outlook as well. The economy of the growing City is already being put to the test. A healthy economy is a condition of life for sustainable growth and securing sustainable growth is the Citys most important task, stresses Jan Vapaavuori.In 2020, the central government transfers for basic public services increase to 280 million euros. A significant part of the increase of around 80 million euros in the central government transfers compensates either the decrease in the tax revenue or the increase that has already occurred in the costs based on the central government transfers. Preliminary estimates show that the equalisation of the tax revenue base, which is included in Helsinkis income from central government transfers, is 376 million euros in 2020. The increase in the tax-based equalisations paid by the Helsinki has been steep in 2017, Helsinki paid -289 million euros in tax-based equalisations.  The increase in the tax-based equalisations paid by the City of Helsinki shows that an attractive and successful capital is widely beneficial to the entire country. The capitals investments in sustainable growth work as resuscitation for a favourable development in the entire country in a situation where private investments are expected to decrease. Helsinkis responsibility for the entire Finland grows and I hope that it adds to the understanding that the best possible operating conditions for the capital to do well in the international competition is an advantage to the entire Finland, says Vapaavuori. According to the City Strategy, investments are kept at a level that can be funded without adding to the per capita indebtedness. The estimate for the loan stock at the end of 2020 is 1,010 million euros, or 1,530 euros per capita.
Helsinkis investment level will exceed one billion euros in 2020. The growth in the investment expenditure is 31,3 percent compared to 2019. Municipally owned company Helsinki City Transports investments are 217 million euros and the biggest single investment project is the construction and planning of the infrastructure for the Jokeri light rail line.
In the investment programme, the focus is put on maintenance of built assets, reaching the housing production goals and investments required by business life, as well as on the development of the service network. In repair construction, emphasis is laid especially on ensuring safety and healthiness in schools and day-care centres.  In
addition to repair construction and investments, beating the challenges related
to the quality of indoor air calls for a new kind of mind-set with an
increasingly comprehensive approach. Rectifying the Citys premises process is
a central priority for the City. In support of this task, the City is currently
working on a real estate strategy, the goal of which is to create an inclusive
joint vision of the objectives for the Citys real estate maintenance and real
estate ownership, emphasises Vapaavuori.The Citys growth is also visible in the increasing investments to reach the Citys housing production goal. In 2018, there were 4,843 housing units completed in Helsinki and the estimated number of completed housing units for 2019 is 6,500. In 2020, the estimated number of completed housing units is 6,800, and in 2021 it is as high as 7,000. The areas of focus in the housing construction are in Kalasatama and Lnsisatama. In 2020, the City continues to implement the long-term wages and salaries development plan, which is based on an analysis of the essential development needs connected to the wages and salaries of the personnel and personnel groups as well as on the employer's needs in ensuring the availability of skilful labour. In the 2020 budget, a total of 5 million euros have been reserved for the implementation of the wages and salaries development plan. Personnel organisations have been consulted in the preparation of the wages and salaries development plan.During the upcoming year, the wages and salaries development plan will put special focus on the situation at the health centre to attract skilful labour especially by developing the wages and salaries of health centre physicians, public health nurses and registered nurses and practical nurses. The performance bonus system used by the City will also be reworked during 2020 and increased rewarding for a good work performance is encouraged.Processing

Helsinki City Library has recorded a higher number of both library visits and loans compared to last year. While the growth has been fuelled primarily by Central Library Oodi, the attractiveness of local libraries has been noted all over Helsinki.In 2019, Helsinkis public libraries have recorded 46% more visits than during the same period last year. By the end of September, Helsinki City Librarys locations had been visited a total of 6.8 million times. The main reason for the increase in visits is the popularity of Central Library Oodi, which opened in December 2018: Oodi is by far the most popular library with nearly 2.5 million visits. However, the library boom has been felt in other parts of Helsinki as well. The next most popular libraries this year have been Kallio Library (324,775 visits) and Itkeskus Library (307,413 visits).Laajasalo and Maunula recorded the highest increases Among the libraries that have experienced a notable increase in visits are Laajasalo and Maunula, which recently moved to new facilities. Laajasalo Library has recorded a 37% increase in the number of visits compared to last year, while Maunula Library has recorded an increase of 13%. Oodis first year of operation has made libraries more visible than ever in Helsinki and throughout Finland, states City of Helsinkis Director of Library Services Katri Vnttinen. It has been great to see how much people love their local libraries, use their services and discuss the tasks of libraries in a critical manner. Oodi, too, has established itself as many peoples local library, and its usage rates are by far the highest in regard to both visits and loans. I hope that people across Helsinki will continue to actively contribute to the development of library services by giving us feedback and participating in events held at libraries, for example.37,000 new library cards and 3.9 million loans In addition to the number of visits, the number of loans and the number of new library cards issued have also increased. By the end of September, Helsinki City Library had issued 37,095 new library cards, of which over 15,000 were made at Oodi. The number of new library cards issued has grown by 54% compared to the same period last year.The number of loans has grown by 6% compared to last year, with library visitors recording a total of 3.9 million loans.Monday is the busiest day at libraries In Helsinki, the most popular day to visit the library is Monday. Based on the number of visits, it is the busiest day at all other public libraries except Oodi, where the most popular days are Saturday and Thursday.At Oodi, the number of visits recorded exceeded 2.7 million in October. The combined number of visits recorded by Helsinkis libraries is expected to exceed 9 million this year, with Oodis share expected to be over 3 million.Helsinki City Librarys service network includes 37 public libraries, 2 mobile libraries and the services of the Home and Service Library for those who cannot reach a library by their own means.Library visits recorded at the locations of Helsinki City Library (JanuarySeptember) 2018: 4,687,058 visits 2019: 6,821,525 visits change 2018/2019: +46%Top 3 libraries in JanuarySeptember 2019 Oodi 2,466,338 visits Kallio 324,775 visits Itkeskus 307,413 visitsNew library cards 2018: 24,053 new library cards 2019: 37,095 new library cards (of which 15,621 were issued at Oodi) change 2018/2019: +54%First loans (not counting renewals) 2018: 3,707,591 loans 2019: 3,944,193 loans change 2018/2019: +6%Photo: Maunula Library by Maarit Hohteri
The renovation of the Hmeentie street area begun in March 2019 has progressed well considering the demanding conditions of the work.Water pipe replacement is 74-percent complete, and 77 percent of soil excavation and 69 percent of rock excavation have been completed. Furthermore, 14 percent of tram lines has already been replaced.According to the current estimate, trams will return to Kurvi, that is, the key juncture on Hmeentie, in spring 2020.At that time, tram lines 1 and 8 will return to their normal routes. Lines 6 and 7 will still run via the Karhupuisto park and Helsinginkatu in the section between Hakaniemi and Srninen.
Helsinki Region Transport HSL will announce the dates of route changes about a month before the changes take place.Tram lines 6 and 7 will return to their normal routes, that is, to run on Hmeentie between Hakaniemi and Srninen, only near the end of the renovation project. As such, they will return to normal routes no later than in late 2020, as originally planned.
The first six months of work at the site have not been easy, as circumstances discovered below street level in the course of the work, such as unknown pipes and cables and structures located elsewhere than indicated on maps, have required the project team occasionally to go back to the drawing board.The biggest deviation from the information available has been 8 metres. This was the pipeline built in 1889, which may be the citys most famous pipeline by now, says foreman Seppo Sirola of the contractor Destia, referring to major flooding caused by a ruptured pipe in the summer.
The project has so far been carried out within the cost estimate drawn up at the planning stage.The final cost of the project will largely depend on how many more new and surprising things well discover underground. At the moment it seems that well be able to meet the planning-stage cost estimate, says Jarkko
Karttunen, a head of unit at the City of Helsinki Urban Environment Division.
  The project has been supported with active communication efforts, which have earned a great deal of positive feedback especially on the projects popular Facebook page.Feedback has been more pleasant than normal on the street as well. The contractors staff have received sympathetic and encouraging messages from passers-by, which is not always the case when a project makes peoples lives more difficult, says the projects communication officer Heidi
Keklinen of Destia.We express our gratitude to all citizens who are affected by the work for their patience. You have been incredibly understanding. However, I must admit that the ordeal is not over yet, says communication planner Lauri
Hnninen of the City of Helsinki.Hmeentie is being converted into a street serving pedestrians, cyclists and public transport between Siltasaarenkatu and Helsinginkatu. It will be possible to drive to properties, and maintenance, emergency and delivery vehicles can use the new Hmeentie, but otherwise private cars are not allowed to be driven through the street.As part of the project, tram tracks are replaced. Pipes and cables running below street level and the Srninen Metro station roof are renovated.The project will increase the safety of walking and cycling, and it will speed up the flow of public transport.
After the renovation, Hmeentie will be an increasingly pleasant living environment, as reduced car traffic will mean less noise and better air quality.The project is scheduled for completion in late 2020. The contactor is Destia Oy.

The voting phase of OmaStadi concluded at the end of October. The number of registered participants was 69,284. The number of voters was 49,705. The voter turnout reached almost eight percent. This was the biggest electronic voting event arranged by the public sector in Finland.Of the 296 plans that were put up for vote, 44 plans were voted to the implementation phase. The plans that went through in the OmaStadi voting 2019 can be viewed here. The plans with the most votes according to area: Southern: Green City 57,000 euros, votes 2052.Eastern: More cleanliness to eastern Helsinki 113,000 euros, votes 1755.Southeastern: Report on the renovation of Aino Ackts villa 100,000 euros, votes 2727.Central: Artificial grass pitch on the field next to Arabian peruskoulu 435,000 euros, votes 2870.Northeastern: Services in support of mobility and well-being for the elderly to northeastern Helsinki 50,000 euros, votes 1182.Western: Urban fireplaces 120,000 euros, votes 1272.Northern: Summer jobs and help for summer tasks 83,000 euros, votes 833.Entire City: More trees to Helsinki 35,000 euros, votes 9234.Voting on concrete local projects has brought a new sense of participation to tens of thousands of Helsinkians. Many of the propositions voted for have been about furthering the Most Functional City in the World in practical terms. Thanks to the citizens, we are many steps closer to our strategic goals, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.In Helsinki, the OmaStadi voter turnout was almost eight percent. The voter turnout for the first round of OmaStadi was favourable in international comparison. In other countries, the voter turnout for participatory budgeting even after many rounds has been around 210 percent.OmaStadi got the people of Helsinki to discuss the affairs in areas togetherOmaStadi brought people together and worked as an inspiration to discuss the affairs of the neighbourhoods, and the development of them, in an entirely new way. This has not happened before at the same time on the city level. The seven borough liaisons of the City have done a great job in communicating the message of OmaStadi in their areas and encouraged citizens to make their own proposals and vote, says Omastadi Development Manager Kirsi Verkka.The people of Helsinki were committed developers during the first year of participatory budgeting. The total number of proposals submitted was 1,273, of which 839 were accepted. The proposals were worked into 296 plans that were put up for vote. The voting result was determined according to how many votes each proposal got and which plans could be included in the budget for the area. The first plan chosen for implementation was the one that received the most votes in the area. After that, the focus was laid on the plan with the second most votes and whether it could be included in the remaining budget for the area. If the plan with the second most votes exceeded the remaining appropriation, then the focus was shifted to the plan with the third most votes. If it could be included in the remaining appropriation, then it was chosen for implementation. If not, then the next one was considered. This method made it possible for smaller plans with less votes to advance to the implementation phase.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori confirms the voting result by the end of this year. The preparation of the implementation of the plans starts next year. In the Omastadi.hel.fi service, it is possible to follow the preparation and advancements of the implementation of the plans during 2020.The OmaStadi model for participatory budgeting has come to stay. Next year, Helsinki once again invites the citizens to make proposals into OmaStadi.Read more:OmaStadi 2019 voting resultsHow the voting result is determinedOmastadi.hel.fi
What is phenomenon-based learning in practice at the schools of Helsinki? Helsinki Education Week provides a good opportunity to find that out, as the schools invite guests to have a look at their everyday operations.For example, visitors at Vesala Comprehensive School can look into workshops led by the pupils, the themes of which cover topics such as robotics, animal rights and research work.The contents of the workshops are based on the pupils own thoughts and interests. The contents were created in collaboration, says teacher Panu Keskinen.The school has a long history of maintaining a culture in which the pupils get to explore and work on things themselves. The school has had a designated plant and animal room for a long time, and several teachers are interested in robotics, for example.Keskinen says that when pupils get to think about perspectives and take their time to look into each theme discussed, their learning deepens as well.The most enthusiastic pupils even work on things on their free time.The pupils knowledge and skills are built together, and the teacher acts as an instructor. Keskinen finds it essential that the pupils suggestions and questions are not rejected immediately. It is equally important to discuss themes through perspectives that motivate everyone to take part. The teacher plays an important role in creating a positive atmosphere.Studying cross-subject topics is key in phenomenon-based learning. The studies focus on real-world phenomena, and the pupils understanding of the topics is built together. The schools allocate time for phenomenon-based learning as an important supplement to the other forms of learning taking place.Heidi Halkilahti laments that discussions regarding phenomenon-based learning are sometimes sidetracked. She works as a project planner in a phenomenon-based learning modelling project at the City of Helsinki.Phenomenon-based learning has sometimes been seen as busywork that is detached from the goals of the curriculum and leaves the pupils to manage on their own.The teachers are bound by a curriculum that also obligates them to take a learner-oriented, communal and multidisciplinary approach. This is not just busywork by any means, but highly goal-oriented, long-term and versatile work with the learners.Halkilahti is a teacher herself. To her, the greatest significance of phenomenon-based learning lies in the value of each pupil: the goal is for each and every young person to find the joy of learning and interest in the world around them. This supports them and helps them develop into enthusiastic learners, as well as active and co-operative citizens.Schools now face a major task in getting pupils to stop, think and focus  in order words, detach themselves from a sense of hurry.Schools used to lack a multifaceted, learner-oriented and long-term process in which the pupils themselves get to carry out things, ask questions, think about things and explore. Not everything is considered a viable study topic, as the activities must always have a goal.Halkilahti emphasises that phenomenon-based learning steers learners towards problem-solving, functionality, a multidisciplinary approach and independent responsibility.No one knows what kind of a skill set will be required from people in the future. Thus, todays learners must learn how to update their knowledge and skills while also discussing things, being critical where necessary and resolving matters together.Practising these multifaceted skills must be included in the school week from the start in order for learners to gradually learn to take responsibility for their own actions and learning, Halkilahti notes.Helsinki Education Week is full of events that enable participants to look into new ways of learning.Teacher Panu Keskinen aims to attract visitors to Vesala by boasting that they will get an opportunity to meet the best learners in the universe.After Vesala, visitors can move on to another school, such as Hiidenkivi Comprehensive School in Tapanila. Phenomenon-based learning is emphasised at Hiidenkivi as well, and visitors will have an opportunity to see how the school applies group pedagogy.Teacher Katariina Rkklinen says that the pupils of Hiidenkivi all sit in four-person groups. The teacher selects the pupils table groups, and the pupils are in the same group for around ten weeks. After that, new groups are formed.The pupils roles change as well. They take turns acting as chairpersons, bookkeepers, organisers, environmental managers, etc. The groups also take various discussion and co-operation exercises.During Helsinki Education Week, Hiidenkivi Comprehensive School will offer presentations open to all visitors, as well as designated presentations for pedagogues.Helsinki Education Week

The artwork Odd cup of Coffee by Artist Antti Immonen was inaugureted in the corner of Kahvikatu and Kahvipavunkuja in Vuosaari on Wednesday 30.10. The artwork tells in an ingenious way of the birth of coffee.

  The artwork consists of four elements, it is about 11 meter long (36) and reaches up to 3 meters height (10).
  
According to the artist, the basic idea of the work is the discussion that emerges when people meet at a coffee table. The topics might be many, but the procedure is almost ceremonial. The piece reflects both this moment and the process that has preceded it, and tells about the history of Vuosaari.The history of the Kahvikortteli (The Coffee Block) started when the well-known Paulig roosting company moved to the site in 1967. The activity ended when the city started the housing building project about 10 years ago."Even if I cant claim that this is a western coffee  ceremony, is has elements of certain solid constructions. I hope that this piece of art mediates this situation with both solid structures and free and lively discussion."Antti Immonen (b. 1973), uses in his art a playful way of testing and variations that has room for coincidents. The completed artwork is often a still of a continuous build and tear down  play.Read more:

The City of Helsinkis cooperation with Harvard University and Bloomberg Philanthropies emphasised the importance of meeting people in person and promoting more agile operating cultures. A multi-disciplinary group tackled the root causes of the lack of mobility among the elderly.How can we find tangible solutions to modern, complex issues, such as increasing inequality, climate change and immobility? How should we face a challenge that cannot be solved by just an individual or their actions? How could we examine the root causes of the problems instead of only treating the symptoms? How can we solve one of the key well-being challenges of our time, immobility?The innovation programme by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University offers tangible tools for solving complex challenges and testing promising new ideas. Helsinki was the only European city to participate in the programme, which was implemented for the first time this year.The City of Helsinki chose the promotion of everyday mobility in the lives of the elderly as the theme for the programme. The reasoning is solid: increasing mobility is one of the Citys main objectives for this strategy season. Of the European countries, Finlands population is aging most rapidly, and Helsinki is no exception to the rest of the country. According to estimates, the number of people over the age of 65 in Helsinki will increase from 108,000 to 170,000 by 2050. Mobility is important to people of all ages, but with age, its significance as a source of functional day-to-day life and independent living increases. Currently, only a few percent of people exercise sufficiently to maintain their health.A team of eleven employees from different City divisions was appointed to the innovation programme. The team consisted of employees who meet and exercise with the elderly, who perform strategic development tasks and who are responsible for digital services, land use planning and home care for the elderly, or who are responsible for the daily accessibility of culture and leisure time services.The team was led by service designer Ruben Ocampo, commissioned by Bloomberg Philanthropies, who specialises in steering urban planning work in the direction of user orientation.I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Helsinki team. Something that really stuck with me was how vested all the team members are in the problem, which was manifested in how engaged they were in learning the methodology that we introduced, the high degree of care they showed in all their interactions with senior citizens, and their commitment to create real, sustainable solutions.The Helsinki team also made me feel incredibly at home! With each interaction we got to know each other more and more, and my last visit to the city had the taste of a bittersweet goodbye. I have continued to follow their progress on this project after the program wrapped up, and I look forward to not only seeing their solutions come to life, but also to staying in touch with the team members, Ruben Ocampo says.Social Advisor Tuula Sillanp from Kustaankartano Comprehensive Service Centre also enjoyed working with the multidisciplinary team.In hindsight, I can say that a discussion as rich as this on increasing the mobility of the elderly could not have been possible without such a multidisciplinary team. What I found excellent about this programme was that the different divisions worked together, she says.The programme was not created out of thin air. Each team member had relevant professional skills or experience from personal life. Helsinki already boasts many services, circumstances and projects that promote mobility among the elderly. Only the amount of research data and number of reports and reviews tops the former.The precise definition of the problem and gaining an understanding of the root causes took time. It is one thing to talk about increasing the number of times someone exercises and quite another to promote everyday mobility.For the elderly, exercise is like medicine, this is something everyone who works with the elderly already knows. During this innovation programme I learned that mobility is not only about exercise or sports. For some, merely leaving the house can be considered a small victory. The elderly residents of Helsinki have a wealth of wisdom and resources that can be utilised in renewing and developing services, says Head of Home Care Suvi Kan from the Social Services and Health Care Division.The training programme also strove to strengthen competence in terms of service development principles and methods within the City organisation. The objective was to utilise the lessons learned from the training programme in development across organisational boundaries as widely as possible.Genuine human-oriented development to create new service concept ideas together with City operators and external operators requires time and effort. The process calls for empathy, curiosity, tenacity and the ability to live with incompleteness. These skills, and foremost the right attitude, can only be learned by doing and experiencing, says Development Consultant Meri Virta from the City Executive Office.The team learned by completing exercises. In the span of nine months, the team members met with more than one hundred elderly people in the course of interviews and testing sessions in shopping centres, health stations, service centres, libraries and adult education centres. The purpose of these exercises was to ensure that any issues were understood thoroughly and that the experiences of elderly people are heard before making any proposals.  The observations of the team show that the life situations, resources, wishes and needs of the elderly are pointedly individual. Aging is related to many changes that can have comprehensive effects  this goes for mobility, too. These changes include retirement or the death of a spouse, falling ill, diminishing physical ability to function and reduced income.The interviews showed that identifying these changes is important and providing the right kind of support in these trying times requires sensitivity. Activity in men, for example, is more related to their physical condition, and when the physical condition deteriorates, social interaction is also reduced dramatically. The relationship to digital services depends on the skills of the individual, but more importantly, on the support network that enables access to the digital world. You should always be careful when making assumptions: an 80-year-old may be more active on social media than a 40-year-old.The interviews highlighted the power of internal motivation and experiences of relevance. The will to engage in activities that are significant to the person themselves may help people overcome obstacles, such as challenges posed by diminishing physical functional capacity and condition. Local services support leading an independent life, which is why the significance of local services and the communal spirit in the neighbourhood is emphasised. As the innovation programme progressed, the concept of activity expanded to mean all social activity, of which actual exercise services only play one part.Older people, seniors, the elderly, oldsters, pensioners. There are many words to describe older people, and there must be at least as many experiences of being something other than what can be summed up in one word. Each elderly person is an individual with their own background and hopes for the future. Supporting lifelong functional ability as well as physical and psychological well-being is the most important thing we can do for each of our fellow human beings, says Education Manager Satu Luomajoki from the adult education centre.The research problem took the following shape in the course of the work: How can we ensure that each old person finds it easy and pleasant to leave the house every day? How could the friends and family of an old person and the professionals working with the elderly support mobility through their speech and actions, while also considering each individuals functional ability, motivation and interests?The team collected ideas to resolve identified issues for the elderly and the professionals that work with them. More than 800 ideas were generated. Two prototypes were tested based on the ideas.The first idea to be tested was the mobility bonus card, which was created to map individual motivational factors. Feedback from the users indicated that services, such as free concert tickets and spending time with friends, were valued more than monetary rewards.The second idea to be tested was the mobility service centre. The idea was born out of the realisation that information on exercise opportunities should be distributed among the people and be presented in an easily understood and attractive form. The team also discussed a service that would make is easier to leave the house in practice and overcome physical and other obstacles. The team decided to try hiring young people as mobility advisors, who could walk with the elderly and keep them company on the way to various activities. This activity is based on an existing Jobd operating model funded by the We Foundation. In the model, young people with an immigrant background help older people in their everyday chores.It is important to hear what the elderly are saying, truly listen and understand what they want, instead of shrugging their opinions off. Many interviewees were very pleased to be asked. Even though the attitude of the old person is often a deciding factor, encouragement from those who work with the elderly is not without merit, because not everyone has their own support network. I also learned that it is easier for some to be out and about when they have a clear destination, such as visiting a shopping centre. It would be wonderful if every old person could have their own Jobd support person whom they could be active with, says Nursing Manager Pirjo Tyllill from Kustaankartano Comprehensive Service Centre.The mobility service centre was tested in a genuine environment in July, in shopping centre Kaari in Kannelmki. Shopping centres are everyday meeting places visited by both senior citizens and their loved ones. They provide a natural environment to reach people and meet each person with their individual needs. The service centre was designed by Harvard University postgraduate student Taylor Greenberg Goldy, who spent the summer taking a deep dive into the content of the innovation project in Helsinki.In Kaari, the service centre experiment gathered information on City services under one roof in the shopping centre. Visitors could find out more about the likes of City sports services, adult education centre classes, home care, social and health care services, and the offering of service centres. Visitors to the centre could measure their grip strength and discuss their mobility, experiences and hopes with City of Helsinki employees. Two mobility service providers from the shopping centre also participated. The purpose was to think of a neighbourhood as an area where all the services that promote and inspire mobility were packaged into a user-friendly package. The two-day test run of the mobility service centre was very educational. Nearly 50 older people and their loved ones visited the centre. Each visitor had their own unique story. These discussions led to the idea that elderly people could act as mobility advisors for each other, sort of ambassadors and contact people between the City and those older people with a high risk of becoming isolated.The idea that the service centre could also have some light activities in addition to serving up information on current services in the area was also floated. The team concluded that the service centre could be used as a place where you could sign up for events and review event attendance afterwards.The understanding of the principles that should be recognised in designing services accumulated during the programme was enriched as a result of the trial.Customer-oriented development opens up the diversity of human life and the countless different challenges and opportunities that serving people presents. People are not a homogenous mass. Understanding individual needs and serving people with a personal touch creates an experience of a functional city, says Chief Digital Officer Mikko Rusama from the City of Helsinki.The innovation programme may be very significant in terms of planning strategic programmes or measures.The innovation programme showed us that before we start thinking about tangible measures, we must take the time to define our goals and understand the root causes. Without a shared understanding of the problem at hand, we risk implementing measures that treat the symptom instead of healing the patient. It was also delightful to understand that measures do not always have to be planned and prepared for years in advance at the office before having the courage to test and subject them to feedback from the people that the measures are for, says Project Manager Minna Paajanen from Helsinkis physical activity programme.The lessons learned from the innovation programme for the promotion of mobility amongst the elderly became part of the physical activity programme of the City of Helsinki. The programme contains nearly 60 measures. The conclusions and observations from the innovation programme have been advanced to processing within the City organisation.Genuinely meeting and listening to people takes time, but also highlight many different viewpoints and individual needs, even quite small things, that could solve mobility challenges for individuals, says Minna Ekman, sports planning officer at the City of Helsinki.Going forward, the most important measures are the ones that clarify marketing and communications directed at the elderly increase local cooperation between the public, private and third sector offer support for older people whose functional ability has diminished and create opportunities for volunteer work.In the innovation programme, we learned that change is only affected by meeting people face to face. Starting from next year, we will focus our marketing efforts on areas that people would visit anyway  places like shopping centres, health stations and libraries. We also learned that many people would like to be of use, but need a little push. We will be making it easier to become a volunteer mobility advisor and increasing cooperation with companies and organisations. All reasons to be physically active are valuable. It is always a triumph when the front door opens, regardless of whether the senior is going to the grocery store, Nordic walking, a hockey game, a concert or the library, says Executive Director of the Culture and Leisure Division Tommi Laitio.Further information:The physical activity programme of the City of Helsinki (in Finnish)The Harvard University and Bloomberg Philanthropies innovation programme team: Executive Director of the Culture and Leisure Division Tommi Laitio, Project Manager of Helsinkis physical activity programme Minna Paajanen, Head of the Development Unit Reetta Sariola, Sports Planning Officer Minna Ekman, Social Advisor Tuula Sillanp, Nursing Manager Pirjo Tyllil, Head of Home Care Suvi Kan, Education Manager Satu Luomajoki, Head of Urban Planning Division Richard Manninen, Chief Digital Officer Mikko Rusama and Development Consultant Meri Virta.City Innovation Track is part of the leadership and management training for mayors provided by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University.

The City of Helsinki is producing new signage for Helsinkis Central Park. The signage is designed to guide visitors on the existing recreational routes. The signage will be installed in two phases: the first part for the park area north of Ring Road I in the spring of 2020, and the second part for the southern section of the park in the following year. A draft of the signage design is now on display (with text in Finnish) at kerrokantasi.hel.fi, the City of Helsinki online feedback channel, and feedback can be submitted until 17 November 2019.The new signage for Central Park is produced in response to significant amounts of feedback from the public gathered in conjunction with natural area and landscape maintenance, as well as through other feedback channels. There is a pronounced need for new signage in Central Park, as the parks extensive route network is supported by inadequate signs.New signs and information panels to be installed in the park will allow visitors to plan their hiking, jogging, cycling and other recreational tours. The Central Park visitor centres and other key sites will be provided with information panels with maps. Key junctures will be provided with maps and signs. The main north-to-south route of Central Park, horse riding trails, illuminated recreational skiing tracks and a mountain bike trail will be marked with bands attached to posts or trees and lighting poles.The extensive cycling and pedestrian route network of Central Park changes for winter months. Central Park is a popular cross-country skiing location, and the ski tracks are maintained. The new signage will separate plowed pedestrian and cycling routes from ski tracks. A new and much requested route to be marked with signs leads from Kuninkaantammi to Niskala and from Niskala to Torpparinmki. This route is plowed in winter.The ski track network is so extensive at places that cyclists and pedestrians are guided to nearby streets, so as to provide Central Park users with much requested plowed detours.A mountain bike trail planned and tested together with bikers will be marked both on maps and in the terrain. The trail will be suitable for all levels of mountain bikers. The most difficult places to cross ditches and wet areas will be rendered easy to cross and safe. The mountain bike trail marked in the terrain reduces wear to the surrounding nature.
The signage plan is now a draft. The makers of the plan request all active Central Park users and occasional visitors to comment on the draft, to obtain extensive and constructive feedback. Feedback can be submitted at kerrokantasi.hel.fiuntil 17 November 2019.Map of

Plans for a new shared hospital of the City of Helsinki and the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) located in Laakso are under way.The hospital area in Laakso is intended as a hub for psychiatric care offered by the City of Helsinki and the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, HUSs specialised neurological rehabilitation, services offered by the Helsinki City Hospital as well as outpatient clinics to support hospital operations.The draft of the alteration of the town plan enables the construction of three new hospital buildings on the current plot. The plan also includes a new main access route and the construction of underground parking and maintenance facilities. No buildings are planned for the Keskuspuisto side.According to plans, the shared hospital in Laakso will have hospital beds for 930 patients. In addition to this, the area will have outpatient clinic premises, which will be located in the buildings that remain in the area, as well as facilities for training and research.A total of approximately 120,000 floor square metres of new space could be built. If the new hospital is built in its entirety, it will be roughly four times the size of the New Childrens Hospital in Helsinki.A new main access route is planned for the customer and maintenance traffic via the underground tunnel starting at Auroranportti. Parking space for 550 cars has been designed in the underground rock facility. The current access routes will remain.The Laakso hospital area is located in an area with easy access. The area enjoys versatile transport connections.According to the vision for hospital areas in the Metropolitan area, psychiatric hospital treatment in the Metropolitan area and the services of the Helsinki City Hospital should be centralised to the Laakso hospital area.The shared hospital of the City of Helsinki and HUS offers new opportunities to provide customers and patients with comprehensive treatment that meets their versatile needs. The shared hospital would employ an estimated 2,200 people.We believe that the new hospital will be an attractive place to work for the professionals in the field. We are developing the Laakso shared hospital into an internationally significant hub of psychiatry, geriatrics and neurological rehabilitation competence that attracts the best in the field to Helsinki, says HUS Psychiatry Project Manager, Chief Physician Kari Raaska, who is involved in planning the new hospital. We must build new facilities. We can no longer use the old facilities or repair them to meet the standards of contemporary hospital treatment, says Project Manager, Chief Nurse Administrator Tiina Pakasto from Helsinki City Hospital.Most of the new hospital facilities in the Laakso hospital area would be concentrated in the area between the old hospital area, Nordenskildinkatu and Reijolankatu. The intention is to preserve and protect the valuable hospital buildings in the northern section of the plot dating from the 1920s and 1930s, the former tuberculosis office from the 1950s and the surrounding park. These facilities will also be renovated for further use. The height of the new buildings on the Urheilukatu side would be close to the height of the roof of the hospital buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s. The height of the buildings could increase by a few levels towards the centre of the area.Main entrances would be located on the new plaza forming at the corner of Reijolankatu and Urheilukatu, in the drop-off area and on the Lkrinkatu side.If the project continues on target schedule, construction could begin towards the end of 2021 at the earliest, and then continue in stages. New construction requires the demolition of some of the old buildings. The operation in these buildings would be moved to new premises prior to demolition.The town plan draft material of the Laakso shared hospital and the scale model of the area are on display 627 November 2019 in the participatory facility Brygga in Central Library Oodi. You can comment on the plans online until 27 November at kerrokantasi.hel.fi. The feedback will be utilised in further planning.The project will be presented in Central Library Oodi on Tuesday 19 November 2019. You can meet the designers in the lobby on the first floor 15.3019.00. Presentations on the planning of the Laakso shared hospital will be held in Maijansali in Oodi at 15 and 18.The objective is to take the plan draft to the Urban Environment Committee in 2020. Decisions concerning the project plan for the construction will be made later on.Image: Indicative draft of the size and placement of the new hospital buildings.

Port of Helsinki has upgraded ten buoys into smart, modern navigational aids. The transition away from old buoys improves environmental friendliness, and the smart technology integrated into the new buoys increases safety in the fairway. The new buoys are part of Meritaito Ltd.s InSea service concept. Safety in the busy fairway at Helsinkis West Harbour will improve as the old buoys were replaced with buoys equipped with remote monitoring and control technology. This allows for data on the buoy, the navigational aid, any deviation from position and other faults to be available 24/7 in real time, and for the luminosity of the navigational aid to be adjusted to the prevailing weather conditions.Real-time situation reports on the location and status of buoys improves safety in the fairway, but also increases the predictability of maintenance and thereby also improves cost-efficiency.The connection of modern remote control and monitoring technology to navigational aids and the comprehensive maintenance service are both part of Meritaitos InSea service agreement, which enables and accelerates the modernization of fairway navigational aids as a leasing service with a fixed monthly fee. The pricing model increases cost-efficiency as leasing fees are easily controlled and budgeted, and customer capital is not tied up in the fairway infrastructure.Read more:Port of Helsinki
In October, the people of Helsinki vote and choose the OmaStadi ideas that the City will implement. The voting has started off well, with more than 40,000 users signing on to the OmaStadi service. Helsinki uses 4.4 million euros annually for city development based on participatory budgeting.The voting takes place in the omastadi.hel.fi service, where you are required to provide digital authentication by means of mobile ID or banking codes.All residents of Helsinki who this year have turned 12 or are older may vote for the plans. The voter can choose among the plans in one major district and the plans on the city level. Votes can be given to as many plans as the allocation reserved for the area allows. Voting is encouraged, as the plans with the most votes will be carried out.Young people in Helsinki vote both on the participatory budget and on the RuutiBudget in the omastadi.hel.fi service. The voting happens with personal Wilma codes.If mobile ID or banking codes are not available, then it is possible to vote by showing an ID at the Citys different service points, such as in some libraries and community centres. At Helsinki central library Oodi, there is a OmaStadi polling station, where it is possible to vote with an ID during the opening times of the library.The OmaStadi voting period is 131 October 2019.#OmaStadi#osallistuvabudjetointiFurther reading:OmaStadiVoting support and eventsHelsinki central library Oodi

On 29 October, the HSL Executive Board decided that the fares for the longest trips, i.e. the prices of ABC, BCD, CD and ABCD tickets, will decrease at the beginning of 2020. The price cuts will apply to both single and season tickets. The prices of AB, BC and D tickets will not change.This is the first time in our 10-year history we make such significant fare cuts. We will lower the fares for the longest journeys, as switching from driving to public transport for the longest journeys is most beneficial in terms of reducing emissions from traffic, says HSL Executive Director Suvi Rihtniemi.The biggest benefit will be to those living in zones C and D, but also people living in zones A and B will benefit from the lower prices. For example, residents of Helsinki buy 27 per cent of ABC tickets and they are the third largest group of people buying ABCD tickets. The level of public transport service is poorer in zones C and D than closer to the center of Helsinki. In zones A and B, the level of public transport service is excellent. Moreover, the validity area of AB and BC tickets is very large and thanks to the 80-minute transfer time, passengers are often able to make both the outward and return journeys with the same ticket. * The prices of AB, BC and D tickets will not change.Read more:HSL

Helsinki has developed the Climate Watch that even in an international context is a unique tool for monitoring climate protection and emissions reductions. Helsinki aims to accomplish carbon neutrality by year 2035, and hence it has launched 147 measures to reduce emissions and attain this goal. Thanks to the Climate Watch, anyone will be able to follow the progress of these measures and their impact on the amount of CO2 emissions in Helsinki. The Climate Watch is a service that comprises data on each measure in the emissions reduction programme and on their progress. Even the background assumptions and calculations that form the basis for the emissions assessments will in future be made public. The Climate Watch shows the order of magnitude of each measure and their effects on the attainment of the goal of carbon neutrality. In the service, you may also search and review Helsinkis climate measures by theme or by body that is in charge.The political decision-makers may make use of the Climate Watch as they assess whether the emissions are being reduced as agreed. Thanks to the open data, the researchers will be able to assess the effects of the measures as well as the underlying assumptions and calculations. In future, also the city residents will be able to give feedback easily on the measures to reduce emissions and express how they would like to be involved in their implementation. The City of Helsinki aims at making it easy for the Helsinkians and those visiting the city to choose a climate-friendly lifestyle.Since 1990, Helsinki has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions already by 27 per cent. In its City Strategy, Helsinki has resolved to attain its 2035 carbon neutrality goal by a mix of measures out of which 80 per cent result in emissions reductions and 20 per cent consist of emission compensation. Thus, carbon neutrality will be attained, i.e. the net emissions should be zero with year 2035 as the period of review.We prepared our Carbon-Neutral Helsinki 2035 Action Plan very transparently and would like to carry on this way also while reporting on its implementation and assessing the next steps. I believe that we will find the Climate Watch to be an efficient tool. Other local authorities are also free to make use of it, says Esa Nikunen, the director general of the City of Helsinki environmental services.Helsinki Climate Watch (in Finnish)Carbon-neutral Helsinki 2035, Summary PDFThe Carbon-neutral Helsinki 2035 Action Plan PDF 
Helsinki is forecast to continue growing almost as fast as earlier. According to the basic alternative of the latest population projection made by the Urban Studies and Statistics Unit at Helsinki City Executive Office, Helsinkis population will be 820 000 in 2050. According to the rapid growth alternative of the projection, it would be no less than 880 000.The new population projection for Helsinki and the Helsinki Region extends to 2050 and the one for Helsinkis districts to 2034. Both contain separate forecasts for the Swedish-language population.Annual population growth in Helsinki is expected at 6,700 on average well into the 2030s, then gradually turning slower with rising numbers of deaths  although not as much slower as in Statistics Finlands new projection for the reason that, in the citys projection, more dwellings are expected to be built than earlier in Helsinki.Over the next five years, the number of small children is forecast to decrease as birth rates fall. The number of 7-15 year olds, on the other hand, rises rapidly up until the mid 2020s, by even more than 1,500 a year.With the large post-war age groups getting older, the number of 75 year olds or older is starting to grow rapidly, by as much as 3,000 per annum in the early 2020s. The number of people of working age is forecast to continue to grow by 3,000-4,000 per annum up until the 2040s, but gradually only the over 50 year olds will be increasing in numbers. A large proportion of population growth will come from immigration.According to the forecast by district for Helsinki extending to 2034, population growth will be most substantial in the large housing developments currently under construction. The population is expected to grow by 13,000-16,000 each in the Kalasatama area, the Jtksaari-Hernesaari zone, Kruunuvuorenranta and the rest of Laajasalo, as well as in Pasila. In Vuosaari, too, the population is forecast to have grown by even 9,000 by the year 2034.Other important population growth areas include Lauttasaari, Kuninkaantammi, Malmin lentokentt, Herttoniemen yritysalue, Oulunkyl, Etel-Haaga, Myllypuro and Mellunmki, where populations would grow by 3,000-5,500 each.Helsinkis Swedish-language population of 36,500 people has grown by 1,335 in the 2010s, and is set to grow by, on average, 130 per annum, reaching 38,000 in 2034.Both small children and school children are expected to increase in numbers. The number of Swedish-language children is increased by the fact that children of families where the father is Swedish-speaking and the mother has some other mother tongue than Swedish are, today, predominantly registered as Swedish-speaking.The numbers of Swedish-language residents are forecast to grow in, especially, the Southern, Central and Southeast major districts. By 2034, the Swedish-speaking are set to increase by over 750 in Southern, by 600 in Central, and by 540 in Southeast major district. The housing developments in Jtksaari, Kalasatama and Laajasalo are, particularly, expected to attract Swedish-speaking people as well.Helsingin ja Helsingin seudun vestennuste 20192050.

The second phase of the Myllypuro Campus of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences was handed over to the client on 17 October 2019, marking the end of construction. The university of applied sciences will commence campus-wide operations in January 2020, when the number of students will reach 6,000.The Myllypuro Campus has been developed by the City of Helsinki for use by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Metropolia has begun to furnish and to equip the new facilities for operations to commence in January 2020, when the public spaces of the campus will also open to the public.It feels good to have this extensive and long-lasting project at this stage. The planning of the campus began in 2012. The planning, coordination and implementation of the project has involved a vast amount of people representing diverse stakeholder groups. Together they have produced a magnificent campus, says project leader Simo Hoikkala.Now we are installing equipment, furnishing spaces and bringing information and communication technology to the facilities. Well all be moving, assuming control of the spaces and learning a new type of operation culture together, he continues.Metropolia has operated in the A-building of the campus since last January. The A-building was the first part of the campus completed. From the beginning of 2020, the Myllypuro Campus will house all of the university of applied sciences social services and healthcare studies as well as real estate and constructionrelated studies, altogether approximately 6,000 students. Accordingly, the campus has been named the Campus for Builders of Well-being.The Myllypuro Campus is part of Metropolias years-long project to focus operations from tens of sites to four campuses located in Arabia and Myllypuro in Helsinki, in Myyrmki in Vantaa, and in Karamalmi in Espoo.Read more from Metropolia:Myllypuro

Helsinki is a more popular international cruise destination than ever. During the cruise season that ended on 22 October, a total of 603,500 cruise passengers arrived in Helsinki. This was 16 per cent more than the previous year. There were a total of 303 ship visits to Helsinki. This was the first time the number exceeded 300. This translates to a 6-percent growth from last year (2018:285).The largest percentages of cruise passengers came from Germany (32%), the United States (21%) and the United Kingdom (10%). The top three nationalities remained the same as the previous year, although the proportion of German visitors grew slightly. The proportions of other nationalities among visitors to Helsinki were all less than 5%.The popularity of Helsinki as a destination for international cruise ships has grown steadily. Helsinki is internationally attractive, and on top of that, everything works. The new LHD quay in Hernesaari, which serves large cruise ships, also proved to be functional. It was opened by the Port of Helsinki at the beginning of May. We have had good feedback on wastewater reception and the general functionality of the quay from experienced captains as well as pilots, says Harbour Master Antti Pulkkinen from the Port of Helsinki. All in all, this season was a success and we were pleased that no large cruise ship had to skip Helsinki due to bad weather in September or October.Read more:Port of Helsinki

In autumn, extra care should be taken near tram tracks as the fallen leaves make the tracks slippery. Fallen leaves crushed under the tram wheels leave an oily residue on the surface of the tracks making tram wheels slip and lengthening the braking distance of trams.Drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are advised to take this into account when moving about the town. Do not cross the street at the last minute if you see a tram coming. Please also remind your children to be careful around the trams. Trams can also jerk when starting from a stop and the slippery tracks can cause delays to trams. The situation is the most difficult in areas where trees grow right next to the tracks, for example on Mkelnkatu and Munkkiniemen puistotie.HKLs track cleaning cars are constantly at work but the wind blows more leaves all the time and the cleaned tracks are soon covered with leaves again.

City Library has launched a project to educate customers in music, how to make music
and how to experience music. The project allows library customers to
familiarize themselves with new music contents and to try out making music. The
project, begun in October 2019, will extend to the end of 2020. The project
also trains the library staff in music pedagogy and equips them with skills to
better present library collections and services to customers.Physical loans of music from libraries and physical sales of music have been reduced as music offerings have largely moved to the web. Digitalization has, however, diversified music offerings to consumers and offers them new opportunities. The new project seeks to familiarize both library customers and the library staff with these opportunities.Project partners comprise the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Kpyl Music Institutes folk music studies, Global Music Centre and Music Archive Finland. The project is supported by the Regional State Administrative Agencies. The Helsinki City Library staff cooperates with these expert organizations representing different musical genres. The cooperation forms the basis of open and free-of-charge music listening groups and music workshops organized by Helsinki City Library. The listening groups and workshops are most suitable for those who wish to listen to new music or to try out making music. One purpose of the project is to reach those citizens who may not previously have used library services at all.
The majority of the listening group meetings and music workshops will be held at the Pasila Library, which has one of the largest collections of recordings in the Helsinki metropolitan area.

The main theme of Helsinki
Biennial 2020 is interdependence: every action and thing has an impact on
something else and supports the whole. Helsinki Biennial, which will be held on
Vallisaari Island, will present around 35 international artists or groups of
artists from both Finland and around the world. The location of Helsinki
Biennial is unique and we are delighted that some 80% of the works are
completely new, Pirkko Siitari and Taru Tappola, the head curators, say.The first artists to be announced are Pawe Althamer, Katharina Grosse,
Gustafsson&Haapoja, Hanna Tuulikki, IC-98, Marja Kanervo, Tadashi Kawamata,
Alicja Kwade, Laura Knnen, Tuomas A. Laitinen, Jaakko Niemel, Mario Rizzi and Maaria Wirkkala. The BIOS Research Unit has also been invited to take part. Helsinki Biennial 2020 will take place on Vallisaari Island from 12 June to 27 September 2020. The artists have been invited to come to Vallisaari and create new site-specific and temporary artworks or to exhibit existing artworks that will engage in a dialogue with the island.The curators of Helsinki Biennial 2020 have given the event the subtitle: The Same Sea. The ecological crisis means we are now on the cusp of enormous changes and this is defining our common future everywhere. The biennials subtitle, The Same Sea, refers to this situation, which concerns everyone but affects different places in different ways. Like the sea, it is a complex, inconstant entirety that bypasses all boundaries and appears different depending on the perspective, the curators say. Vallisaari is the actual and conceptual starting point for the curation of Helsinki Biennial and has provided direction and inspiration for the work of the artists. The curators have explored the island with the artists, discussing it as an artistic context and seeking suitable locations for the artworks.Vallisaari has an exceptional atmosphere. It's like a zone touched by some unknown force. Yet, there is something there that reveals part of our collective memory, a part which we no longer have words to describe. The combination of its built environment and closed history and its untamed wildlife and environment on a small scale makes it a special place for an artist, says Maaria Wirkkala.The artworks will be located outside along the cobbled path and inside historical buildings, gunpowder cellars and empty residential buildings. This will highlight unknown and abandoned places and give them new meanings.
In addition to its geopolitical location, cultural history and nature, Vallisaari presents the artists with broader topical site-specific questions. These include time and change, the relationship between people and other species, and the micro and macro worlds that are beyond everyday observation. A few of the artists are working on subjects that originate from the daily life of Vallisaaris former inhabitants and the islands military history. According to the curators, some of the artworks deal not only with the local and global consequences of human activity but also with alternative visions of the future.In accordance with the Helsinki City Strategy, the biennial emphasises sustainability and responsibility, and these values are being respected as much as possible in the implementation of the event.Making and presenting art on Vallisaari requires complex cooperation to take the delicate environment into account, Siitari and Tappola say. "The idea and site of each artwork have been evaluated from the point of view of nature conservation and preservation of historical buildings.
The delicate environment sets a strict framework for the art event, and HAM will collaborate with Metshallitus, which manages Vallisaari, to safeguard it. An environmental programme will also be created for the biennial on the basis of the EcoCompass environmental management system.
In September 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC published its second report, which proves the accelerating speed of climate change and the severity of its consequences. We believe that art has an important role in these circumstances. It has the unique ability to broaden our way of thinking, our understanding and our imagination, the curators say.Helsinki Biennial will make Helsinki even more attractive to residents and tourists from the perspective of art and culture by presenting works by leading international artists from Finland and around the world.Helsinkis bold and uncompromising investments in art also have a broader impact on the development of our home city, including the well-being of residents and the attractiveness of Helsinki as a tourist destination. Helsinki Biennial will further raise Helsinkis status as an interesting city of culture and art, says Mari
Mnnist, Culture Director of the City of Helsinki.Helsinki Biennial is also a part of the City of Helsinki's maritime strategy, which is turning the city's archipelago into an attractive destination by making maritime services more accessible to all. The art event is a new reason to explore the city's archipelago.In collaboration with Metshallitus, Helsinki Biennial will transform Vallisaari into a treasure island of art  a truly unique attraction.Helsinki Biennial is an
international contemporary art event that takes place every two years. HAM
Helsinki Art Museum is responsible for its production and curation, and the
head curators are Pirkko Siitari, Head of Exhibitions at HAM and Taru Tappola,
HAMs Head of Public Art. Helsinki Biennial is part of the Helsinki City
Strategy and will be held for the first time on Vallisaari Island from 12 June
to 27 September, 2020. The main partners of Helsinki Biennial 2020 are
Metshallitus and the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation. The Jenny and Antti
Wihuri Foundation and the Swedish Cultural Foundation in Finland are also
supporting the biennial. All artists, artworks and the
Helsinki Biennial programme will be announced in spring 2020.In the summer of 2020, the
Academy of Fine Arts will organise an art event on Kuninkaansaari Island,
located next to Vallisaari, at the same time as Helsinki Biennial.helsinkibiennaali.fi
Helsinki Impact Conference, organised by the City of Helsinki, invited decision-makers, experts and researchers to join forces and examine the role of cities as global change-makers in the future of Europe. The conference, held at Musiikkitalo in Helsinki on 910 October, was part of the official programme of Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and its theme was particularly topical: it is cities that serve as the stage for nearly all contemporary phenomena such as immigration, accelerating inequality and climate change. As cities grow quickly, it is important to find solutions to promote the well-being of both people and the climate. Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori opened the conference with a speech highlighting the significance of a long-term attitude towards the challenges cities face. Vapaavuoris opening address was followed by a three-person panel discussion, where the former chair of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme Joan
Clos stressed the immense speed of urbanisation. It is estimated that the urban population of the world will double by 2050. Throughout history, cities have been hubs for wealth, jobs and human capital, which is why the challenges of cities keep increasing in step with population growth. As challenges become more difficult at an increasing speed, we must come to a social contract that everyone can accept.Deputy Mayor Maria Vassilakou from Vienna continued by explaining how Vienna had succeeded in staying at the top of the list of the most liveable cities in the world for the past ten years. Comprehensive and affordable public transport, developing the city in a more child-friendly direction, comprehensive public housing production throughout the city and the construction of large green areas make Vienna a top class city to live in. This creates spaces where people naturally slow down their pace. The third participant in the panel was Marko Peterlin, director of the IPop research institute. He shared experiences from Ljubljana, which is dominated by vehicles and where traffic generates massive amounts of emissions resulting in high costs. Peterlin emphasised three points in his speech: instead of efficiency, we should be talking about a good day-to-day life private operators can help build networks to resolve social issues and we should always look beyond early adopters when designing solutions. Themes of the talks in the afternoon included data democracy, truly equal urban and social politics, and means of developing better cities. The first speaker of the afternoon, Chief Technology and Digital Innovation Officer at Barcelona City Council Francesca Bria stressed the significance of a human-centric data society. Europe must be careful not to drift into a North American system of data giants, where data is owned by the mighty and few. On the other hand, we must also be wary of drifting towards the Chinese model of using data to monitor people. Because it is the people who produce the data, they must also own and control it. City Dramaturg Tunde Adefioye from City Theatre of Brussels explained the lay of the land when it comes to truly equal urban and social policies. He asked an important question: how can we promote an open and equal city, if the decision-makers never come face to face with all of the realities that the residents must confront? The question emphasises the importance of diversity in decision-making bodies. If cities and other bodies are developed without listening to marginalised groups, politics cannot be truly equal.Brent
Toderian, who has developed cities on all continents for the past 25years, gave the closing speech of the afternoon. Toderian reminded us that plans are not enough to mitigate the climate crisis. We must also act on our plans, and in Helsinki we can promote the implementation of climate goals by expanding the pedestrian district in the City centre. All in all, city development should put the pedestrian first, because cities designed for cars are not even ideal for motorists. For this reason, cycling should not be promoted at the cost of pedestrian walkways: the right solution is to do it at the expense of car lanes.The second day of the conference took a more in-depth approach to the themes of the previous day, ensuring that the conference would become more than just words. The day was kicked off by State Secretary Jari Partanen, who emphasised that Helsinki, as one of the most ambitious emissions reducers, plays a key role in climate action, and that enabling effortless mobility is an important means of reducing emissions. Climate action should focus on people and remember to look to the future in addition to the present. Jyrki
Katainen made a video appearance and talked about European climate measures, such as funding mechanisms for urban technology development. The Urban Innovative Actions initiative, for example, is currently accepting applications, and five Finnish cities have already secured funding.The speeches were followed by the publication of the joint Helsinki Impact Declaration by Helsinki, Stockholm and Tallinn. The declaration outlines tangible planning solutions. The declaration stresses the significance of systemic change through means covered during the conference: cities must invest in combating climate change, working towards developing a human-centric internet and ethical use of technology, improving urban environments through spatial planning and facilitating social equality and more inclusive cities.For the rest of the afternoon, participants had the chance to choose a small group of their liking and discuss data, resilient districts, the development of the Metropolitan area and digital innovations. The day, and with it the entire conference, ended with a summary of the discussions of each small group. Helsinki Impact Conference showed that we are unanimous when it comes to urban challenges, and we even seem to see eye to eye on the elements of the solutions. Learning from each other is key along with functional and innovation-promoting politics as well as confidential cooperation between the City, residents and operators at state level. A functional social contract promotes social cohesion, and reliable, human-centric data enhances and improves city services. The conference was sure to provide many people with new perspectives on the resolution of global urban challenges, and hopefully bred new coalitions that are ready to experiment with solutions.The conference

The Kipparlahti Metro rail bridge will be rebuilt in the summer of 2021. The bridge project will allow for increases in the axle weight of Metro trains and the Metro capacity. The Kipparlahti bridge is located about half a kilometre to the west from the Herttoniemi Metro Station. The bridge crosses over the street of Kipparlahden silmukka.
The present load capacity of the Kipparlahti Metro rail bridge, completed in 1972, does not allow Metro axle weights to be increased and the Metro system to be developed further. Due to the bridge construction, the bridge cannot be reinforced but has to be rebuilt.In addition to allowing the Metro system to be developed, the construction of a new bridge enables compliance with an overpass for the Itbaana express cycling way projected to be built next to the Metro rail bridge, says project manager Eero Valkama of Helsinki City Transport HKL, the Metro system operator.Because of the rebuilding of the Kipparlahti Metro rail bridge, there will be no Metro service between Itkeskus and Srninen for about two weeks in the summer of 2021. Helsinki Region Transport HSL, the metropolitan public transit authority, will organize replacing service for the duration of the break in regular Metro service.
The rebuilding of the Kipparlahti bridge is one of many components in the Metro rail system development that allow axle weight and capacity increases.The Kulosaari Metro rail bridge, another Metro rail bridge in the eastern part of the Metro rail system, was reinforced in connection with the bridge renovation in 2017 to allow the bridge to carry larger loads. According to plan, the Siilitie and Sahaajankatu Metro rail bridges in the same area will also be reinforced. All Metro rail bridges will be reinforced by the end of the 2020s, at the time of HKLs planned new Metro fleet acquisitions.

The HSY Board of Directors approved new price lists for domestic water and waste management at its meeting of 11 October 2019. The new price lists will be applied from the 1st of January 2020 onwards.
  Water usage and monthly charges will increase by 1.1 percent on average. The wastewater charge will remain unchanged at 1.75 euros per cubic metre.Fees for the collection of recyclable waste from properties, such as biowaste and plastic packaging materials, will be reduced, as HSY wants to encourage Helsinki region residents to sort and to recycle their waste. Fees for the emptying of waste containers will go down by the following average amounts:Waste container emptying fees for small metal items and glass will remain unchanged. Emptying fees for unsorted waste  that is, containers for mixed waste  will increase by 4.7 percent on average.According to waste management regulations, biowaste, plastic, glass and cardboard packaging materials, and small metal items will be collected separately from properties with no less than five housing units from 2021 onwards. Properties can already place orders with HSY for containers for the sorting of waste fractions at their property.HSYs Sortti waste stations will begin to receive plastic and textiles, which are entered as new waste fractions in the price lists. Prices for some waste fractions, including combustible unsorted waste, stone materials and wood, will be increased to meet cost increases. Charges will be introduced for pressure-treated wood, which has been received free of charge, because of risen transport and handling costs.Many household wastes, such as hazardous waste, electrical appliances and metals, can be delivered to Sortti Stations free of charge.Pricing policies and practices seek to encourage residents to sort their waste.Read more from HSY:Domestic waterWaste

The renovations will be carried out inside the hospital building in restricted sectors. As such, they will not affect parking areas or any routes outside the hospital.In 2016, moisture was discovered in the concrete floor tiles of Building 2 in Malmi Hospital. After the test renovations and drying processes are completed, the renovations to the hospital building will start on 15 October 2019. The City of Helsinki will be in charge of the renovations. The floors will be dried and floor materials changed in all areas with excessively damp concrete tiles. We are currently comparing the qualities of various materials and selecting the suitable material for the floors. According to the test drying and renovations, drying the concrete tiles of a single floor may take a year, at the maximum. The selected surface material affects the duration of the drying process. According to the indoor air analyses made, the humidity measured under vinyl floor membranes does not impact the indoor air in the hospital. The moisture of the concrete tiles has weakened the vinyl floors attachment to the surface.
The Night of the Homeless, an annual theme day focusing on poverty and social exclusion, is celebrated on 17 October 2019. This year, the days event in Helsinki is held in Srninen in the style of a street festival, with happenings at the Vaasanaukio square and on the streets of Vaasankatu and Kinaporinkatu from 16:0022:00. The event is open to everybody and free of charge. The patron of the Night of the Homeless in Helsinki is the President of Finland Sauli Niinist.A panel discussion on homelessness at Vaasanaukio, starting at 18:00, is joined by:
The Night of the Homeless is the largest annual event focusing on social and health policies in Finland. The Helsinki event this year is joined by 36 active players in the theme, which is an all-time record in Helsinki. The organizer of the event is The Night of the Homeless citizens movement.Finland is the only country in Finland that has managed to reduce homelessness in recent years.The Night of the Homeless events of 2019 put a special emphasis on homeless women. There were more than 1,200 solitary homeless women in Finland in 2018. Their number in Helsinki was approximately 650. (Source ARA: Asunnottomat 2018, a report on homelessness in 2018 by the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland ARA, 5 March 2019.) Homeless women are exposed to diverse exploitation, and many experience violence. Many womens experiences are closely tied with family, children and motherhood.Following The Night of the Homeless on 18 October, the Sininauhasti group opens the first day centre for women in Helsinki, located at the corner of Ruusulankatu and Sibeliuksenkatu in Tl. The day centre is open from 10:0014:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at first, and the opening hours will be extended as necessary.When homeless people obtain homes of their own, many of their health and other social problems can be solved at the same time. Housing First is a model for solving homelessness. The core idea of Housing First is to prioritize housing over other support activities.

IBM and EY have published their latest reports. They both are strengthening previous surveys: Finland offers an excellent business environment for industries that require skilled labor and are based on high-value jobs.According to the recent EY Attractiveness Survey, Finland attracted again most foreign investments in the Nordics. Finland has kept the leading position now for seven years in a row. The most attractive industries in Finland were ICT, Health and consulting services. The strength of Finland is versatility among other things. Finland has been able to attract investment to several sectors, the CEO of EY Finland Mikko ijl comments on the press release of EY.When the survey compared Nordic cities, Helsinki was clearly number one with its 95 investment projects. For instance Stockholm had 33 and Copenhagen 32 projects last year. Also Espoo (17) and Vantaa (11) attracted significant amount of projects. So the whole Greater Helsinki had total number of 123 investment projects last year. Few of the assets in Greater Helsinki, according to Mikko ijl, are the start-up friendliness and atmosphere that supports innovation. These create an attractive business environment for many foreign companies.IBM Global Location Trends report presents and analyzes the latest developments in corporate location selection around the world. Finland and Greater Helsinki were in the TOP 5 destinations when the survey compared the average project value based on the value of jobs. This supports other surveys and reports that Greater Helsinki is very competitive globally when it comes to the high-value industries.One sector where Helsinki outperforms year after year is ICT and tech and no wonder. According to an external survey ordered by Helsinki Business Hub and Business Finland, Finland has significant skills resources across all technical skills areas. Only Greater Helsinki has 83 000 IT professional and when commuters are added, the number of experts rises to 152 000. The survey also points out that Finland stands out with interdisciplinary skills. A high percentage of the workforce has other technical skills experience too. In addition to ICT, Finland has a significant talent pool in engineering, health tech, cleantech, and financial services.Read moreHelsinki Business HubThe EYAttractiveness SurveyIBM Global Trends report
Of the City center harbours in Helsinki, approximately 5.6 kilometres of quay structures belong to the Port of Helsinki. The oldest quays date from pre-war times and the most recent quay in Hernesaari was taken into use in the spring of 2019, says Planning Engineer Tero Sievnen from Port Technical Services.The quays are constantly being worn down by the sea and the weather conditions. Maintaining quays in the Port of Helsinki requires skill and a good concept of the condition of the underwater structures.Underwater steel sheet walls and reinforced concrete poles as well as the erosion protection structures at the front of the quays bear the brunt of the rough sea and northern weather conditions. The erosion protection structures are designed to shield the port basin and quays from the erosion caused by slipstreams generated by vessels.The underwater condition of quays can be examined using several methods, from traditional condition surveys performed by divers to digital multi-beam probes and modelling.Condition surveys performed by divers are slow and relatively expensive, but result in detailed and comprehensive reports. Diving will not work very well, however, if the water is murky and the diver cannot see farther than their own hand.Digital surveys, on the other hand, can be used to gain a more comprehensive perspective more quickly.All of the quays in the Port of Helsinki have been surveyed by diving at least once.

The island of Vallisaari will have a modern water supply and sewage network provided by the City of Helsinki and Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY). The network will be connected to the HSY water supply and sewage system by a pipeline running on the bottom of the sea between Suomenlinna and Vallisaari.Construction starts with the marking of the course of the pipeline with buoys in the sea area between Suomenlinna and Vallisaari. Excavation work for the pipeline started at Lnsi-Musta in Suomenlinna in the week of 7 October. Pipes will be laid later in the autumn.The work will be conducted largely on sea lanes for boats and ships. The work may cause minor disruptions to boating but will not interfere with the movement of larger vessels on the sea lanes. The work will also involve some underwater excavation.The goal is to complete pipe laying by the end of the year. However, depending on winter and ice conditions, pipe laying may have to wait until the spring. Autumn storms may also slow the work. The contractor for the project is GRK Infra Oy.The water supply and sewage network of Vallisaari is built by Metshallitus (a Finnish governmental organization that includes parks and wildlife administration). The project to develop the network was launched last summer.
Project-related construction on Vallisaari will continue through the rest of the autumn. It is forbidden to go ashore and to move on the island during 711 November 2019. The restrictions are due to removal of old explosives and work-related, required safety zones.The water supply and sewage network will improve services on Vallisaari. For visitors, this will mean flush toilets rather than dry toilets. Entrepreneurs will enjoy improved conditions for restaurant, caf and other operations.
The construction of the Vallisaari water supply and sewage network forms a part of the future detailed plan for the area. The plan will support the development of the island further as a nature destination. The twin islands Vallisaari and the adjacent Kuninkaansaari are located next to Suomenlinna and can be reached by ferry from Helsinki Market Square in 20 minutes. Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari are managed by National Park Finland of Metshallitus.The Helsinki Maritime Strategy provides guidelines for the development of the services and appeal of the local archipelago and waterfront areas to 2030. The goals of the strategy are to improve maritime services and access to maritime destinations, to promote maritime events, and to continue to open local islands for recreational uses.
 Deputy Mayor Pia
Pakarinen represented Helsinki at the international UNWTO Global Summit on Urban Tourism top summit in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. The summit focused on the concept of Smart Cities, Smart Destinations.
  In line with the UNs New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, smart cities have the potential to make cities more manageable, accessible and environmentally friendly for both residents and tourists. UNWTOs international tourism summit focused on how the cities can address complex urban challenges.
 The declaration that was approved for signing at the summit recalls, among other things, that 60 per cent of the worlds population will live in urban areas by 2030 and that cities are increasingly popular as tourism destinations. The declaration also includes a commitment to developing tourism through the furthering of innovations, technology, accessibility and sustainable development in tourism. It also includes a commitment to promote a culture of open data and new approaches to technology, such as mobility-as-a-service smartphone solutions. 
  When Helsinki succeeds in its ambition to be the most functional City in the world to its residents, then we are also an interesting city for tourists. The City is a platform for new innovations and offers open data - using these elements we work with our partners to make a better City, step by step, said Deputy Mayor Pia Pakarinen in her speech. 
 Helsinki has been a pioneer in the development of sustainable and digital tourism services. Last year, Helsinki received the first prize, with Lyon of France, in the European Capital of Smart Tourism Competition and the best place in Juniper Researchs study concerning digital tourism services. Helsinki is currently drafting a programme for sustainable tourism, in which the City takes a stand on several sectors of tourism. The programme will adhere to the UNs sustainable development goals and it will also support Helsinkis goal to be carbon-neutral by the year 2035.

Helsinki invited other cities and collaboration partners to take systemic and rapid actions in solving global challenges. The joint declaration was signed on 10 October 2019 in Helsinki as a conclusion to the Helsinki Impact Conference. During the two-day Helsinki Impact Conference, policy makers, urban planners and researchers of the cities discussed the role of the cities in the future. As a result of the conference, the leaders of Helsinki, Stockholm and Tallinn, as well as the European collaboration networks for cities and metropolitan areas EUROCITIES and Metrex signed a declaration, in which they commit to advancing a solution to global challenges. The cooperation between cities and learning from each other is indispensable, when we want to find solutions to burning issues. The pace both in the climate actions and in the construction of socially equitable cities must be stepped up from what it has been thus far, emphasised Deputy Mayor Anni Sinnemki, who signed the declaration on behalf of the City of Helsinki.In the declaration, the signatories commit to advancing:In the declaration, the signatories also highlight the need for a more ambitious EU Urban Agenda.It is great that our city partners have joined Helsinki in conveying the message to the European stages that the significance and financing of urban policy must increase during the European Unions next funding period, rejoices Sinnemki. The declaration was signed by Deputy Mayor of Helsinki Anni Sinnemki, Deputy Mayor of Tallinn Andrei Novikov and Vice Mayor of Stockholm Dennis Wedin, as well as by secretary general of EUROCITIES Anna Lisa Boni and secretary general of Metrex Henk Bouwman.The discussions and moods of Helsinki Impact Conference can be recalled on the web: hel.fi/hic2019.Video recordings of both days are up on the site.Link to the declaration:The future of Europe is made in cities  Helsinki Impact Declaration, Helsinki 10th October 2019Read also:Helsinki Impact Conference offered tangible solutionsIn the picture (from left): Dennis Wedin, Stockholm, Anna Lisa Boni, Eurocities, Andrei Novikov, Tallinn, Anni Sinnemki, Helsinki, och Henk Bouwman, Metrex.

This
week, Mr Chen Jining, the mayor of Beijing, will visit Helsinki. The visit is
set to deepen Helsinkis cooperation with one of the most important world
cities. As they meet, mayors Jan Vapaavuori and Chen Jining will sign a
four-year intercity cooperation agreement, whose themes stretch from city
planning to environmental conservation and cooperation in the field of
innovation.Mayor Chen is the leader of the worlds largest capital city by population. Cooperation with Beijing, a city of 21 million people, is a key theme in Helsinki's international strategy. Nurturing a close relationship between the cities opens up opportunities not only for developing Helsinkis own operations, but also for exporting Finnish expertise to China.The importance of international city-level cooperation is constantly growing. We have been determined in our efforts to develop our relationship with Beijing. Cooperation in areas such as tourism, education and cultural exchange has been intense in recent years. Now, we want to strengthen our partnership with one of the leading world cities further. Together we are able to find solutions to global challenges that cities are faced with, such as better measurement of air quality or the use of digitalisation in urban development, Mayor Vapaavuori asserts.The number of Chinese tourists coming to Helsinki has doubled in a short space of time. Helsinki wants to tap into the growing interest to visit here and to be a pioneer in developing services for Chinese travellers. The basis for the close relationship between Helsinki and China has been built by Finnair's strong Asia strategy, as a result of which there are currently around 50 direct flights per week from Helsinki to China.One of the most visible elements of this cooperation is the Chinese New Years celebration, which since 2007 has been observed in Helsinkis city centre. Last year, the event was expanded with a business-oriented parallel programme.Mayor Chen will hear about cutting-edge research in information technology, artificial intelligence, air quality and 5G technology during a visit at the University of Helsinki. New learning environments and digital learning tools will be introduced to the Beijing delegation at a Helsinki comprehensive school. The programme also includes visits to Helen Ltd.'s underground heat pump plant, cultural sites in Helsinki and local companies.The visit will culminate in a dinner hosted by Mayor Vapaavuori, which will include not only the top management of the cities but also leaders from Finnish business and cultural life.
A unique feature of Helsinki is the citys 130-kilometre-long waterfront route open to use by citizens and service providers. It will be increasingly easy in the future to develop services for waterfront areas. A new charting of service sites compiled in the summer of 2019 currently contains 120 possible sites for various activities such as cafs and water sports. In addition, waterfront route signage is being tested and under public evaluation.In accordance with the Helsinki Maritime Strategy, services in waterfront areas and signage on the waterfront route will be improved on the basis of resident feedback and feedback gathered through participatory budgeting.
The charting of new service sites on the waterfront route is based on interviews of waterfront area zoning representatives and area planners, as well as on detailed plans, reports and other plans. The data, gathered for the first time for the entire length of the waterfront, eases the work of City experts, entrepreneurs and other actors looking for suitable sites for their operations. New sites for operations will be handed over mainly through public application procedures.Six new signage models have been created for waterfront signage, and these models are now on public display and can be commented on, for example, on the social media accounts of the City of Helsinki Urban Environment division. Public feedback will be used as a basis for the design of the signage, which will be placed on waterfronts in the summer of 2020. The first routes with signs will be a tour of the inner city and a tour around Laajalahti.Shorelines form the forefront of Helsinkis maritime region. They are now being strengthened to serve everybody by improving signage, by easing the operations of entrepreneurs and by other means. Entrepreneurs have requested from us a better overall picture of what operations are suitable for different sites on waterfronts. The goal of the maritime strategy work now under way is to strengthen opportunities to increase services on waterfronts and, at the same time, to attract investments and to create jobs, says Minttu Perttula, project manager for the Helsinki Maritime Strategy.Helsinkis maritime areas planned comprehensivelyThe charting of maritime service sites combines the visions of planners, the ideas of entrepreneurs and the wishes of residents.Possible sites for new services on Helsinki waterfronts are now for the first time compiled onto the same map, to be available for all. The planning of waterfront areas is a balancing act between nature conservation values and the appeal of recreational uses. It is of utmost importance to secure the conservation of fragile maritime nature and, bearing that in mind, planning must recognize sites on waterfronts that can withstand recreational uses. Other sites are marked unavailable for active use, says Meri Louekari, an architect for maritime areas.The charting was conducted especially to serve entrepreneurs with the objective of continuing the work later on.The charting serves as a new tool that eases cooperation between entrepreneurs and the City. It helps us to diversify and to increase waterfront services, says Suvi
Tuiskunen, a business liaison at the City of Helsinki Economic Development division, who works with maritime and other entrepreneurs.Read more:Sites for new services on the Helsinki

Port of Helsinki has made a repeat order for Cavotecs MoorMaster automated mooring system as part of wider efforts to optimize safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This is the second MoorMaster order at Port of Helsinki and follows similar orders from the Port of Turku and Port of Tallinn in recent months.An auto-mooring system decreases the time taken for vessel mooring and release. The time saved amounts to significant reductions in fuel consumption, improved local air quality and reduced noise pollution, says Sari Nevanlinna, Vice President Passenger Services, Port of Helsinki. The Port of Helsinki is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of harbour operations through its Carbon Neutral programme. Auto-mooring systems at the busiest berths play a vital part in the successful reduction of vessels carbon emissions. As our passenger terminal, T2, is centrally located, nearby residential areas, reducing the impact of harbour operations is of the utmost importance to us, Nevanlinna adds.Cavotec will supply a multi-unit MoorMaster automated mooring system for berth LJ8 at Port of Helsinkis Western Terminal. The 180m-long ROPAX ferry M/S Finlandia will use the system two to three times a day. The Finlandia is operated on a service to the Estonian capital Tallinn, where another MoorMaster system is currently being installed. A similar MoorMaster system was introduced at the Port of Helsinki in 2016, which has carried out more than 5,000 moorings to date.Read more

 Helsinki is preparing the international one million euro Helsinki Energy Challenge competition to find a solution for replacing coal in the most sustainable way possible.Helsinki is committed to its responsibility in curbing climate change. Helsinkis goal is to be carbon-neutral by the year 2035. Currently, more than half of Helsinkis carbon dioxide emissions originate from the production of energy used for heating. Reaching the carbon-neutrality goal requires, in addition to the other actions, that the emissions originating from the production of heat are reduced significantly.The Finnish government has decided to place a ban on the burning of coal for energy production by 2029. As more than half of all the heating energy used in Helsinki is still produced using coal, this ban will have a major impact on the City. Helsinki does not want to settle for the most obvious solution and replace the use of coal with biomass, because biomass is not a problem-free and sustainable energy source either, due to carbon dioxide emissions and biodiversity issues and to questions related to the availability and transport of biomass.In order to find answers for a truly sustainable, long-term and holistic energy solution for Helsinki, the Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori has launched the global one million euro Helsinki Energy Challenge. The question of the challenge is simple  how to replace coal with as much carbon-neutrality as possible and with as little biomass as possible.The competition is arranged to provide all parties with an equal opportunity to bring their solutions to the table for evaluation on the same terms. Helsinki Energy Challenge invites solution and technology developers globally to propose their solutions. Helsinki Energy Challenge will be open globally for all  for companies, consortiums, research institutions, universities and others.Helsinki will also challenge other cities to join in and work to solve the question of emissions-free heating. In addition to solving Helsinkis own challenge, the Helsinki Energy Challenge aims to find solutions with potential to solve global decarbonisation targets outside Helsinki and Finland as well.Climate change is the most crucial challenge of our time and Helsinki is one of the leading cities championing the fight against it. Helsinki Energy Challenge aims to find solutions for Helsinki but also more broadly for other cities around the world. Our partners will play a key role in achieving this goal. The C40 network collaborates with the Challenge already at the development phase. World Economic Forums Global Future Council is one of our partners in ensuring our success and the global relevance of the Challenge, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The preparation of the competition is underway. The planned duration of the competition is about one year. The competitions start date and registration details will be published later. Helsinki encourages interdisciplinary and innovative discussions, challenging the most obvious solutions in energy production. The background information of Helsinkis current heating system has been published on the energychallenge.hel.fi website, to make sure that those interested in the topic can already start preparing for the competition. The organisers of the competition also welcome feedback.energychallenge.hel.fiCarbon-neutral Helsinki 2035, Summary PDF
The years-long Keski-Pasila development project will reach an important milestone when the new traffic connections in Pasila, i.e. the Teollisuuskatu tunnel and a section of Veturitie, are opened to vehicle traffic during the day on Tuesday 8 October 2019.
When approached on Nordenskildinkatu from the south, Veturitie opens to the north along the new route that runs under Tripla. The newest section of Veturitie to the north of Tripla runs along the western edge of the railroad until it reaches Iso Paja on Pasilankatu. Most of the traffic near Iso Paja at the intersection of Veturitie and Pasilankatu will be directed to Veturitie. The intersection will be equipped with traffic lights. There will be changes to priority, i.e. those coming from Pasilankatu will have to yield.The pedestrian cycle routes will remain in their current locations in early October, and the new routes will be opened on 17 October, which is also when Tripla will be opened. The pedestrian and cycle routes are scheduled to open later than the vehicle routes to ensure safety and to allow for the finalising touches on Tripla. The area around Tripla will need to accommodate deliveries and construction site use in late October until the shopping centre, new station and public transport terminal are opened on 17 October. More than three thousand people work in the area. They are finishing and decorating the premises and moving stock into the shopping centre around the clock, says Project Director Pivi
Ahlroos from City Executive Office.Traffic management systems such as barriers and systems related to traveling below Tripla will be tested in early October. The entrances to the Tripla parking facility will be located on Firdonkatu and Tornikuja in Pasila, and opened on 17 October.The Pasila public transport terminal  i.e. the bus and tram stops located on Pasilansilta bridge in front of Pasila station  will be commissioned in the early morning hours of Thursday 17 October. The finishing work in front of the station will not yet be complete, which means that people will have to travel via alternative routes at first.Important dates for Pasila 8 October The new section of Veturitie and the Teollisuuskatu tunnel are opened to traffic.17 October Tripla opens and some of the pedestrian and cycling routes are opened.17 October The new Pasila station is opened.
  17 October The Pasila public transport terminal  bus and tram stops outside the station  is commissioned.21 October New public transport routes are opened.21 October The additional western track, or track 11, is commissioned at Pasila station.Guide maps of the new routesMap 1: New vehicle traffic routes inPasila from 7 OctoberMap 2: New pedestrian routes inPasila from 17 OctoberMap 3: New cycling routes in Pasila from 17 OctoberPasila station, Tripla shopping mall and Music Museum Fame to open on 17 October
Helsinki wants to be the most functional city in the world. Above all, functionality means smoothness as you go about your daily life. Using digitalisation as a means, the City intends to develop services that anticipate the needs of the Helsinkians and meet their requirements in an increasingly individual manner.The citizens will better than previously be the focus of the services. The City also wishes to make use of the data it collects to speed up decision-making.This year, Helsinki has started several ambitious digitalisation projects. They will set in motion a series of changes with regard to both new technologies and the culture of city development as well as the municipal organisation and leadership and the skills of municipal staff.
What will digital
Helsinki look like?Through examples it is perhaps easiest to grasp the opportunities that digitalisation entails. This is for instance what smoothness in daily life could be like in a near future, as Helsinki is turning increasingly digitalised:Services when you
need them  familiarise yourself with the brochure and the digitalisation

about municipal digitalisation (pdf).You may also keep abreast of Helsinkis advances in digitalisation by following the digi.hel.fi website, where you will find news as well as information about events, objectives and practical action with regard to digitalisation efforts by the City of Helsinki. The website will also carry stories about how digitalisation affects you, depending on whether you are a resident, an entrepreneur or e.g. a municipal employee.Helsinki is not the only one to have chosen this path. The City is cooperating closely with, among others, the cities of New York and London in order to seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence, open data and digital innovations in the best way possible.Follow Helsinkis advances in digitalisation on digi.hel.fi and debate on Twitter using hashtag #digihelsinki.
The safety and traffic arrangements of the worksites of Helen and Helen Electricity Network were under thorough scrutiny of the worksite cyclist for the summer. Safety observations will evolve into measures in the planning of worksites and the development of a contracting model.Worksite cyclist Aleksi Pippuri, who cycled about a thousand kilometres and visited a total of 150 worksites over the summer, made safety observations that resulted in both immediate and long-term changes in worksite arrangements.It has been rewarding to see the results of my work in real time in the reporting system for safety observations. The worksites reacted to my feedback and remedial measures were carried out promptly, says Pippuri.The safety observations made by the worksite cyclist are now examined at Helen as a whole and they are used in the development of worksite arrangements.In future, we will be even more proactive in the planning of worksites and in communicating about them, says Helens Construction Manager Lauri Utriainen.In accordance with his job title, the worksite cyclist moved about on his bicycle, and he also studied the traffic arrangements from the pedestrians point of view. It is important to Helen that the worksites are safe and the traffic arrangements are smooth for all, regardless of their mode of transport.The work has opened my eyes to the citys infrastructure: I have stood at the edge of worksite excavations and seen how electricity and hot water are conducted to the homes of local residents. Everything that keeps this city running is beneath the streets, says Pippuri.Read more:Helen
The Helsinki energy company Helen is building Finlands largest heat storage facility in former underground oil storage caves in the Mustikkamaa island. The reconverted caves will store hot water. The amount of hot water that can be stored in the caves corresponds to 40 times the amount of water in the pools of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. The underground heat storage facility will reduce Helens carbon dioxide emissions by 21,000 tonnes.The heat storage facility is one of Helens many solutions on the companys path towards carbon-neutral energy production.
Construction work in the underground spaces for the facilitys equipment and in a tunnel is now fully under way. In addition, district heat pipes are being installed from the Hanasaari power plant area to Sompasaari and to the underground district heat storage facility. The heat storage facility will be connected to the district heat network with the help of an existing tunnel that runs from the Hanasaari area under the sea and Sompasaari to the Mustikkamaa island.The Mustikkamaa heat storage facility will make the energy system increasingly flexible, as the charging and discharging of energy will help to ease peak demand for heat. As the energy of the storage facility is discharged, it can be utilized as such as district heat.The Mustikkamaa heat storage facility will be completed and ready for production in 2021.

The City of Helsinki's Kalasatama Digital Twins project won the international Cities Visionary Award, as well as the Judges Supreme Award, which is the main award of the entire event, at the
  TechFest event arranged in London at the end of September.
The award strengthens Helsinkis intention of being a leading digitalisation city in the world. The award shows that Helsinkis persevering work to make use of new technology in the Citys services and development has been recognised and acknowledged widely by professionals around the world.Digital
twin is creating the most functional City in the worldA digital twin makes it possible to use modelling to plan and study the city even before the actual implementation of the projects. A way of doing things, which is based on data models, makes it possible to analyse data and observe systems both to improve future planning and to foresee problem situations. The idea of a digital twin is not a new one, as, for example, the first Helsinki 3D city models were made of the Kamppi area as early as in 1987.During the last few years, Helsinki has taken giant leaps in the 3D modelling of the City. A digital twin means a way of planning, testing and building products and services in a virtual environment before the physical production phase. In the industry sector, similar industrial modelling has been conducted for some time and according to a study, its monetary savings has been about 10 % of the total costs of the operations.Helsinki aims to be the city in the world that best capitalises on digitalisation. Digitalisation and making use of digital tools also hold a special instrumental value in the carrying out of Helsinkis vision to be the most functional City in the world, which offers the most fluent urban everyday life to its residents. I am proud that the work done by Helsinki also receives international appreciation and praise, notes Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Helsinki
is a global pioneer of city data modellingDigital city modelling is growing globally, but Helsinki is clearly heading the development with its own work. Other progressive cities and collaboration partners are Rotterdam and Singapore. A big part of Helsinkis progressiveness has to do with the open data that Helsinki offers to its partners and how it enables a change in the work and approach towards increasingly open and information-based, tested city development. Helsinki has made digital twin models of the Kalasatama area, which are more detailed than the models of the entire City. The Kalasatama Digital Twins report includes, among other things, the technologies used by Helsinki and it is thus also a way to help other cities that are interested in digital modelling.Digitalisation
is a huge opportunity for the global city developmentInternational cooperation is at the core of digital modelling. For the cities, it is a way to better meet the global challenges of city development. By means of modelling, it is possible to truly create better life in an ecologically sustainable world. The UN has estimated that globally around 2.5 billion people will move from the countryside to cities before the year 2050.If similar figures to the 10 % cost savings of the industry sector could be reached globally in city construction efficiency through digital modelling of cities, then cities could be built for 250 million people for free using savings. In addition to this, significant improvements can also be reached in the optimisation of carbon neutral cities and in the maintenance of existing structures, says Jarmo Suomisto, Project Manager for Helsinki's 3D model.Helsinki has carried out a pilot study for the digital twin model especially in Kalasatama, where the City offers high-quality 3D models as open data to all operators and collaboration partners. The Citys wish is that these city model platforms would further the diverse product development, research, education and innovation activities in the field and contribute to increasing the understanding of the great potential of digitalisation in city development.Helsinkis competition project can be studied in further detail on this video.Further

Helsinki Impact Conference will this week bring a great number of decision-makers, researchers and urban policy influencers, who take an interest in sustainable city development, to the Music Centre in Helsinki. As host of the Conference, the City of Helsinki wishes to boost inter-city cooperation, which is needed to solve global problems and to tighten the European community. Cities create opportunities for smooth and good every-day life. They are trendsetters and a platform for the most important solutions of a sustainable future when it comes to energy production, development of balanced neighbourhoods or digitalisation that improves services, reminds Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki, who will open the Conference.At the same time, the cities role and significance grows when it comes to solving the global challenges in society. Therefore, the cities should have more say when decisions on these matters are taken around European and international tables.
The invitation-only event on 910 October is aimed at leaders, developers, scientists and urban policy makers in European cities. The speaker line-up is world-class: it includes the likes of Canadian Brent Toderian, who inspires us to create livelier and increasingly solid cities, and Italian Francesca Bria, who illustrates the social values of digitalisation.The entire programme of the Conference and presentations of the speakers can be found at hel.fi/hic2019. All city residents and people who are interested in the development of cities are welcome to follow the live broadcast from the event at Oodis Kino Regina, Kanneltalo and Vuotalo on 9 October from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm and on 10 October from 9:00 am to 2:30 pm. (N.B.! the broadcast at Vuotalo only on 9 October) Participation in the conference is made possible through the interactive screen.io application.
The Conference is arranged by the City of Helsinki in collaboration with the Eurocities and Metrex networks as well as Urban Academy. Helsinki Impact Conference is one of the City of Helsinkis main events during Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union.Helsinki is in many respects a forerunner of sustainable city development. For example, Helsinki is the first European city that has committed to the reporting on the UNs sustainable development goals, and it now challenges other European cities to join the sustainable city development. The cornerstones of Helsinkis sustainable development are its aim to reach carbon neutrality and equal urban planning.In Helsinki, the sustainable solutions are not only environmental-friendly and energy-efficient, but they also build on the overall wellbeing of citizens and dynamic residential environments, Mayor Vapaavuori points out.Internal cohesion in Europe arises from prosperous cities and neighbourhoods. Helsinki has in its strategy pledged to go on preventing segregation as a top example and to advance equality and well-being in the neighbourhoods. Helsinki's solutions on sustainable city development have been brought up during Finlands Presidency of the Council of the EU, which started in July. Helsinkis solutions are presented in a nutshell on the Signals from Helsinki website.

Helsinki is preparing its Art and Culture Vision for 2030.As part of the planning process, residents were asked what they thought art and culture should look and feel like in the City of Helsinki in 2030. The summary of the visions shared by residents in an online survey is now complete. The responses stress that the residents want to make art and culture an even more diverse and visible part of everyday life than before. 
   The visions for the future described by the respondents highlight megatrends such as equality, internationality and multiculturalism, nature and sustainable development, community and participation. Events are emphasised as a singular theme. The respondents want Helsinki to host all kinds of events from large, world-class events to block parties and underground gatherings all year round in the near future. People also want to secure the necessary resources and premises for art. Furthermore, people want art and culture to become an even more integral and tangible part of everyday life and a more visible part of the design of public spaces and areas, quite literally. In terms of age groups, the need for art and culture services for children and young people is emphasised.A short online survey on what residents would like art and culture to look like in Helsinki in 2030 was open to the public between 22 May and 31 August 2019. Respondents were encouraged to examine the issue from many viewpoints, e.g. who should produce art and culture, where art and culture could be experienced and made as well as what aspects of art and culture should be better acknowledged. The respondents were asked to describe an individual thing or idea that they would like to be realised or to submit a more comprehensive vision. Nearly three hundred respondents shared their dreams and ideas.
   
  
Thanks to all of those
who replied and shared their vision of the future. I was impressed by how much
effort people had put into describing quite comprehensive ideas. Even though
our sample was relatively small, the material offers important insight for the
Art and Culture Vision Committee to use in their envisioning of the future of
Helsinki. For me, these dreams speak of a living, breathing, eventful cultural
city, the presence of art in the everyday life of the city and opportunities
for people at different stages in their lives to participate and feel at home
in Helsinki.says Aleksi Malmberg, chair of the art and culture vision committee.Click this link to view the survey summary (In Finnish) 
   The Art and Culture Vision utilises the insights of both residents of Helsinki and experts. The Art and Culture Vision Committee has held meetings since February. The Art and Culture Vision Committee is chaired by Aleksi Malmberg, general manager of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. The other members of the committee are Emeritus Director Leif Jakobsson MA(SvenskaKulturfonden) General DirectorGitaKadambi(Finnish National Opera and Ballet) ProfessorElina Knihtil(Theatre Academy) Planner-teacher Emmi Komlosi(Helsingin Tyvenopisto) Choreographer and Artistic Director Sonya Lindfors(Urbanapa) Artist and Doctor of Fine Arts Teemu Mki(chair of The Artists' Association of Finland) Managing Director EekaMkynen(FinnishMetalEventsOy) Managing Director Sara Norberg (Cinematic) and Senior Advisor Veli-Markus Tapio(Finnish Cultural Foundation).The committee will be organising open events for operators in the field of art and culture in the autumn of 2019.

Helsinki is becoming considerably more international and diverse, as about two-thirds of those relocating to the city currently come from places beyond Finlands borders. In order to sustain the vitality of industry and commerce in Helsinki, the region must be able to attract a substantial amount of additional international skill from abroad. To be able to meet these needs, Helsinki will improve its English-language services by 2021, entailing all its divisions. The improvements will be felt especially in the Citys digital services and in its customer service.At the outset of 2019, the proportion of residents who speak a foreign language as their native tongue was 15.7 percent of all Helsinkians, and the English-speaking Helsinkians share of the whole foreign-language population was 6.6 percent. That is to say, there are slightly over 6,700 English-speaking Helsinkians. It has been estimated that the size of Helsinkis foreign-language population will grow by almost 100,000 people up until year 2035. Thus according to the estimate, just above one-quarter of all Helsinki inhabitants will be foreign-language residents. Moreover, for many immigrants, English serves as a support language before and as they develop language skills in Finnish or Swedish.The City will improve the services for immigrants e.g. by regularising the operations of International House Helsinki that is a joint pilot project of the Citys immigrant counselling and several other players. The City will set up a centralised English-language employment, training and housing counselling service at International House Helsinki. In future, English-language counselling regarding employment and education will be provided at the counselling desk of the Employment Service Marketplace, too.Presentations of daycare centres, schools and educational institutions, the most essential guides as well as registration and application forms for parents and students will be provided in English in future. The student admission and the practices for the implementation of suitability tests will be developed to facilitate for arrivals to apply to English and bilingual training. Helsinki will also endeavour to lobby the government with the aim to enable the passing of even the matriculation examination in English in the future. The health stations appointment scheduling will in future be provided also in English, both online and on the phone. Furthermore, the City aims at providing the customers with important care instructions as well as patient and client records in English, when necessary.The Culture and Leisure Division will increase the volume of English-language activities, especially for the young and for children. In addition, course registration and multilingual communications will be developed.As for housing-related issues, a centralised English-language counselling system will be set up. The objective is also for the Citys housing subsidiaries to have English-language web pages in the future.In addition to increasing the English-language content on the municipal websites and to mending the digital service paths, the City will survey the language skills of staff whose work involves providing service and counselling to clients. The staffs language skills will be labelled in a clearly visible manner.Development Agenda for the English-Language Services (pdf)
The Outpatient Clinic for Functional Disorders of Helsinki University Hospital HUS has been operating since May 2019. The clinic treats patients whose symptoms appear to have no apparent cause. The clinic seeks to control and to reduce such symptoms. In addition to patient care, the clinic conducts research and develops the treatment of functional disorders on the basis of the research.The clinics personnel comprises a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist and a social worker.Functional disorders comprise a wide range of diverse disorders and varying syndromes. In the early stages of its operation, the clinic focuses on the treatment of patients who have been examined carefully at other HUS units but whose disorders cannot be shown to have an exact cause with currently available examination tools.There is no uniform medical care recommendation for functional disorders in Finland yet. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has been preparing a statement on the treatment of functional disorders but has not released the final version of this statement. In addition, the preparation of a medical care recommendation for the chronic fatigue syndrome is about to get under way.As we wait for Finnish medical care recommendations, the clinic utilizes international care recommendations and knowledge based on empirical research on the impact of the treatment of functional disorders. Our clinic is not associated with any single international unit, and we keep an open and inquisitive mind regarding emerging care practices, says Chief Physician Helena
Liira at HUS.Scientific understanding of the causes of functional disorders keeps developing, and the specialists associated with the clinics operations monitor new research findings constantly. The clinic is also about to begin its own research.The Outpatient Clinic for Functional Disorders is also tasked to develop the treatment of functional disorders. The clinic seeks to increase awareness of functional disorders and to develop care of these disorders throughout the country by compiling a network and by training medical care professionals.Read more from HUS:Outpatient

Researcher
  Silviya Korpilo believes citizen science democratises research and provides an opportunity to affect ones surroundings. In this regard, the help offered by 230 Helsinki residents is furthering the planning of the citys Central Park in an increasingly sustainable direction.On a ten-kilometre route along the River Vantaa, from Tlnlahti Bay to Haltiala, there are altogether 1,100 hectares of forest in a nearly natural state. The park is home to foxes, brown hares, weasels and many other animals. If you are in luck, you may even spot a falcon gliding above the trees.In addition to animals, you will meet runners, cross-country cyclists, commuters and bird-watchers in the forest. Any one of them may well be participating in research.Helsinkis Central Park, running through Helsinki and Vantaa, is a research topic of particular interest to Korpilo, since more than two million visits are made to the park every year  almost as many as all of Finlands national parks put together.Korpilos doctoral dissertation focuses on the use of the park for leisure, and how related data can be utilised in the parks further planning, as well as to protect its ecosystem.Korpilos research partners were the City of Helsinki and park visitors. Together with volunteers, she conducted citizen science.The city wanted to engage citizens and hear what they had to say about making Central Park as enjoyable as possible for all. Instead of investigating peoples movements in the forest by conducting a survey, Korpilo employed the volunteers smartphones and GPS data.As they moved about in the forest, exercise applications on their phones collected data on their movements. A route map was generated after each run, cycling trip or dog walk, which the participants could then upload to a website compiling the data. At the same time, the volunteers responded to a short survey, providing background information and describing the factors affecting their route choices.
The more that data was entered into the site, the more accurate was the view Korpilo and the City of Helsinki gained concerning forest usage and development needs.According to Korpilo, problem-solving and engaging ordinary people in research are clearly trending activities. Advanced technology accessible to consumers has been the biggest agent of change.Change also democratises science. That happens out of necessity, since research often involves human habitats, which people have the right to influence.If you are trying to solve social or environmental problems, you cant exclude the people whose lives will be affected by the choices made. Engaging people in research helps them have a say in their own surroundings and, consequently, society.Engaging is not the only issue. Locals or individuals who have focused on a certain species often possess better knowhow than scholars themselves.Science requires human power, Korpilo summarises.As a rule, it is easy to get people to take part in citizen science projects. They only need to be sufficiently passionate about the subject matter in question. Some people are map enthusiasts, others are very interested in birds or stars. If that passion can be harnessed to benefit the common good, even better.Indeed, Korpilo encourages everyone to google for citizen science projects, for example by writing ones area of interest followed by citizen science in the search field. Certain projects employ exceedingly peculiar ways of conducting research.

The Helsinki City Board approved a project plan for new M300 Metro trains at its meeting of 23 September 2019. The total cost of the proposed project is EUR 40.7 million euros. The final decision on the project plan will be made by the Helsinki City Council.
The project plan concerns an acquisition of five four-car Metro trains of series M300. The resulting expansion of the Metro fleet would allow the frequency of Metro trains to be increased, and it would ensure that the Metro systems capacity would be adequate to meet the needs of increasing ridership as the West Metro expands.
At the moment, the highest number of Metro trains in service is 36, which translates into 80-percent capacity utilization. The realization of a call option to acquire new M300 Metro trains and an increase in the fleet utilization rate would enable the number of trains to be increased to 43 from the end of 2023 onwards.The Metro operator Helsinki City Transport cannot serve expanding ridership by raising the utilization rate of the current fleet. Consequently, an acquisition of new Metro trains cannot be avoided.The City Board also approved for City Council consideration the raising of the price ceiling for the expansion and renovation of the Mkelnrinne Upper Secondary School, stated in the expansion and renovation project plan, by 3.8 million euros. As a result, the total cost of the project without value added tax should be no more than 20.8 million euros without value added tax at April 2019 cost levels.The expansion and renovation project is part of the Urhea Campus construction at Mkelnrinne, combining studies, sports and housing. The project plan comprises an extensive technical renovation in the current upper secondary school building and an expansion that will link the upper secondary school with Urhea Hall to be built at the same site and with student housing to be built at an adjoining site.Furthermore, the City Board approved a land use plan to be signed with VR-Yhtym Oy related to a detailed plan alteration in the area of Maaherrantie in Verjmki. The purpose of the detailed plan alteration is to enable high-density residential development in the Oulunkyl Station area and on the Raide-Jokeri light-rail line under construction.All City Board decisions are posted on the decisions

Many European youth work experts gather at the Intercity Youth (ICY) conference at Tiivistm in Helsinki on 911 October 2019. The themes of the ICY conference in Helsinki are participatory co-operation in youth work, youth activism, and partnerships with associations. The conference programme comprises interesting keynote speeches by international and Finnish speakers, various field trips in the Helsinki metropolitan area, and participatory workshops and lectures on youth work projects focusing on partnerships and activism. The conference is an important opportunity for youth workers representing different parties and countries to come together. The seminar will be conducted in English.Keynote speeches will be delivered by the likes of award-winning speaker of the year 2017 and biohacker Teemu Arina youth researcher Tomi Kiilakoski, who will be talking about the youth work curriculum (NUPS) Director of The Youth Shelters in The Finnish Red Cross Leena Suurp and youth researchers Marko Kovacic from Croatia and Jon Ord from the UK.The workshops will focus on topics such as child-friendly urban planning in Belgium, youth participation in decision-making in Slovenia and the Icelandic youthwork model. Visitors will be offered diverse opportunities to learn more about the different forms of youth work in the metropolitan area by visiting places such as Ohjaamo, Operaatio Pulssi!, youth organisation Oranssi and Children of the Station. The Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the meeting of European youth work branch leaders held in Finlandia Hall at the same time are reflected in the programme, where applicable.Registration is open until 30 September on icyc.munstadi.fi.
Harju Youth Centre will continue to operate as normal at its current facilities on Aleksis Kiven katu until the end of 2019. From January 2020 onwards, the centres operations will be transferred to other Youth Services facilities in accordance with the plans to regionalise cultural youth work. Suitable facilities are currently being sought. The condition and ventilation of Harju Youth Centre were surveyed in spring 2019. Based on the deficiencies found in the surveys, the youth centre will undergo maintenance repairs and follow-up surveys in the autumn, with the aim of providing a comprehensive impression of the current condition of the building. After this, a repair plan and cost estimate will be prepared for more extensive repairs, based on which decisions will be made on follow-up measures. Decisions on the future use of the Harju property will be made by committees after the preparation of the repair plan (the Urban Environment Committee and the Culture and Leisure Committee).We want to ensure an environment for young people and employees that supports operations in the best possible way. The change is the result of multiple factors, such as the condition of the building and the expansion of cultural youth work in different parts of Helsinki. We are doing our utmost to find suitable facilities and will be providing more information as soon as we know more, says Director of Youth Affairs Mikko Vatka.

 Helsinki Education Week will be held from 4 to 8 November 2019. The number of events has more than doubled from last year: Helsinkis day care centres, schools and educational institutions will be organising over 200 events related to learning around the city.The event week programme emphasises the voice of the learner, well-being and comprehensive learning. The week promises to filled with a wide variety of events organised by learners, such as workshops and discussion sessions, focusing on topics such as coming up with ways to increase participation, showcasing peoples own enterprises, relaxing the body and mind and coming up with ideas for and preparing new school lunches. Many of the events also will involve learning with the help of new technologies, such as robotics and game platforms.Helsinki Education Week events are all free of charge. The events are aimed at groups of children and pupils, teachers, principals, parents and guardians as well as companies  i.e. anyone interested in learning and the development thereof.

Several Helsinki areas are being monitored with the aim to coordinate recreational, tourism and natural values. Residents and visitors appreciate the peace of the recreation areas, but they also find that there is a lack of services. The Urban Eco Islands project exploits smart solutions, e.g. aerial drone images, to monitor and manage recreational use in order to preserve the natural values.Helsinki will open up new islands for recreational use according to its maritime strategy. Last summer, the City enabled more visits to the island of Vasikkasaari next to Suomenlinna by regular boat service, as the City enabled more extensive use of the island. This particular island is also a development object of the Urban Eco Islands project that was launched recently. The same project involves the development of the island of Aegna off the city of Tallinn.There is substantial fluctuation as to the number of visitors to the natural areas depending on the day of the week or the season and on the accessibility of the place and how well known it is. Using a visitor counter, the City has now for instance for more than a year been monitoring the number of visitors using the popular and accessible footbridge path to the Helsinki island of Lammassaari. During peak season, there have been approximately 2,200 visitors walking the Lammassaari footbridge in the span of 24 hours, while the annual number of visits to the area is about 138,000. This is equivalent to the annual number of visitors to the Repovesi national park in Southeast Finland.Vasikkasaari was opened to a larger public only last summer, and hence it being not so well known was reflected in fewer visitors compared with other similar natural objects this past summer.The City intends to add visitor counters to the Helsinki area of Vanhankaupunginlahti and to other natural areas in the City as well. Thanks to the counters, the City will be able to identify the most popular natural objects and assess how the number of visitors affects the environment in each particular case.Data about the number of visitors help us plan the paths, the rest areas and the information boards of the natural areas. We steer the visitor flows towards marked paths in order to preserve the diversity and the beauty of the environment, says Kaisa Pajanen, head of team at Helsinkis environmental services.As part of the Urban Eco Islands project, Forum Virium, which is the City of Helsinkis innovation company, will test smart solutions to monitor the nature and the environment on Vasikkasaari.New and developing technology will enable, among other things, the use of drones, in this case small rotorcraft, to monitor the island nature.Drone photography is fairly easy and fast in favourable weather conditions. It is easy to repeat the taking of pictures regularly, which makes it possible to more regularly than previously, through walking the terrain, e.g. monitor how the paths and the environment are being worn, asserts environmental inspector Tuomas Lahti.Thanks to a live camera on the island, smart technology also enables you to virtually tune into the feeling of being on Vasikkasaari, something you can do e.g. during a break at work. Smart technology identifies the vessels that pass by and provides real-time data about air quality and the noise level.The City wishes to take the residents and the visitors expectations into account as it goes about developing the recreational areas. People who visited Vasikkasaari last summer through the Urban Eco Islands project were asked to respond to a survey about the area.Generally speaking, the visitors were very satisfied with their visit to the island. According to the results, almost 80 per cent of respondents rated the natural values of the island as being really important, even more important than its cultural and recreational value. On the other hand, more than half of the respondents wish there were restaurant services on the island.On the one hand, people try to find their way from the urban beat into the peace of nature, but on the other hand they still wish that services that belong to the urban environment should be easily available, observes Annika Harlio of Helsinkis environmental services and the leader of the Urban Eco Islands project.The City of Helsinki is the main coordinator of the biannual Urban Eco Islands project, whose partners are Forum Virium Helsinki, the City of Tallinn and the SEI Tallinn unit, which is part of Stockholm Environment Institute. The European Regional Development Fund, Interreg Central Baltic, funds the project.Further informationUrban Eco Islands projectVasikkasaari live channelHelsinkis maritime strategy outlines the development of the service supply and attractiveness of the archipelago and the waterfront until year 2030.

The construction of a new bridge in Jtksaari will commence around the beginning of October, and trams and other traffic are scheduled to travel on the bridge as soon as the spring of 2021. The bridge construction site will have no effect on the Jtksaari traffic, but the related pile-driving may cause noise.The main work phase will consist of the construction of a pile base between the eastern end of the bridge (at the pier of Valtamerilaituri) and West Harbour Terminal 2. This will be the base of the bridge and local street structures. Piles will be driven on weekdays from 7 in the morning to 22 at night.
As soon as the bridge is completed, tram line 8 will again be running to and turning around at Saukonpaasi, and tram lines 7 and 9 will be running on a Jtksaari loop, because line 7 cannot turn around owing to the West Terminal construction work.Temporary traffic arrangements will be in place until 2022 at the Bunkkeri turn-around site. The Tahitinkatu turn-around site will be completed in the following year, that is, in 2023. Once the Tahitinkatu site is completed in 2023, the local tram line network is complete, and line 7 will run to Tahitinkatu and lines 8 and 9 to Bunkkeri.
The construction of the Atlantinsilta bridge and new tram lines will be paralleled by the construction of waterfront support walls and surrounding street areas. Other municipal infrastructure and lighting will also be constructed. The breakthrough of LED lighting meant that the Jtksaari lighting plan, drafted since 2005, had to be redone.Streets, parks and playgrounds have their own lighting requirements. The Jtksaari outdoor lighting can be recognized from half-globe shaped hanging lights and graphite-grey pylon street furniture. The pylon model was designed specifically for Jtksaari. Double cables are needed in the maritime district of Jtksaari, in order to prevent lights from swinging in high winds.
Hanging lights are favoured in densely built city districts such as Jtksaari. The supporting cables of lights are fixed on building walls in the narrow streets of Jtksaari. On main streets, cables are fixed on pylons shared with tram lines. The final outdoor lighting can usually be built only when streets and the buildings lining the streets are complete.The most common colour temperature of lights is 3,000 kelvins, which has the appearance of warm white.Today all new outdoor lights in Helsinki are LED lights. Helsinki has a total of 87,000 outdoor lights. The LED technology saves a great deal of energy compared to conventional lights, which is important for the citys goal to be carbon neutral by 2035. Lighting maintenance needs are also reduced. Conventional lights have to be replaced once in every 34 years, but the service life of LED lights is estimated to be 25 years. Furthermore, the efficiency of LED lighting can be adjusted freely. For example, nighttime lighting levels  and electricity consumption at the same time  could be dropped to one-fifth of normal lighting levels.Its well worth coming to admire the lighting of the Jtksaari bridges  Rokkiporkkana and Crusell Bridge  from longer distances, recommend contracting manager Teemu Rinne and lighting designer Taneli Lehtonen.Read more:Jtksaari on Helsinki New

The Tlnlahti movement challenge that started in July has already amassed 20,000 kilometres. The campaign, which is the brainchild of the City of Helsinki, aims at travelling a distance that is equivalent to Earths circumference, that is to say 40,000 kilometres, before the end of December by making laps around Tlnlahti Bay.Having reached midway, the campaign wants to celebrate this feat by arranging a juice party Thursday 26 September at 36 p.m. at the Helsinki container on the southern end of Tlnlahti.Tlnlahti is a unique natural and cultural oasis immersed in the beating heart of the city. The Tlnlahti world tour movement challenge inspires individuals and communities to make a tour around Tlnlahti for the benefit of Baltic Sea conservation.After 18,182 laps or about 40,000 kilometres on the milometer, the City of Helsinki will donate 50,000 euros to the clearing of plastic waste from the Baltic Sea.The donation will be handed to the Baltic Sea Challenge that is steered by the cities of Helsinki of Turku and that will use the money to finance speedy experiments. The funding will be used to support innovations that reduce the amount of plastic waste in the Baltic Sea environment, in the archipelago and along the coast.The Tlnlahti world tour is part of Helsinkis programme for the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU. Instead of treating conference guests to presents, the City invests in lasting environmental achievements.Check the globe onwww.maailmanymparysmatka.fi to keep track of how the world tour advances. The average distance travelled per day is 350 kilometres, i.e. approximately 160 laps around Tlnlahti a day.It is amazing that people individually and together with their workmates become enthusiastic about doing good, say Harri Pulliainen and Marta Tiainen at the Helsinki container where they guide people who tour the bay.It is easy to participate and no registration is needed. This is a tip, for instance, for the recreational day at the workplace or for choosing the route for a walking meeting. Why not do as, among others, Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori, who took up the challenge by making a lap around Tlnlahti and having a walking meeting with Tallinn Mayor Mikhail Klvart as the latter was in Helsinki for a visit.This week, we will have reached halfway of the journey, and soon thereafter the shores of New Zeeland. The fact of having come midway through will be celebrated with juice that is served Thursday 26 September at 36 p.m. at the Helsinki container on the southern edge of Tlnlahti. At the same time, you can easily challenge yourself and your mates to join the world tour. Welcome!Further information:

The Helsinki Olympic Stadium will have a natural grass field, built with cultivated turf grown in Finland. The turf will be brought to the Olympic Stadium this autumn. The turf base has been built with care, in order for the grass to take root well before the winter. Everything possible will be done to make sure that the turf will be in stellar condition in the spring.The new natural grass field of the Olympic Stadium will have to withstand hard wear. The grass must perform well for all events organized at the Stadium, ranging from sports to concerts. In order to achieve a top-rate natural grass field, all components  grass types, the base, fertilizers, chalk, technology and the conditions  have to match.The field of the Olympic Stadium has been fitted with more than the regular amount of underground drainage pipes, to prevent pools from forming on the turf especially in shady places. The soil in which the grass grows is more permeable than earlier. Water has to pass through the turf efficiently, but water must not wash away fertilizers. The soil also should not be too easily compacted, and the grass roots should have enough air. According to field master
  Jani Kurvinen, designated as the Olympic Stadiums own grass whisperer, the Olympic Stadiums natural grass field will have the best grass in Northern Europe. The turf has been cultivated with top-rate grass types in a top-secret place in Finland.
The Olympic Stadium reconstruction work is under way. The Stadium will be a multi-purpose arena that meets the requirements of major international events. New floor space will amount to 19,290 square metres. The total floor space of the Stadium including the field and spectator areas will be 90,000 square metres.The Olympic Stadium is now scheduled to be available for regular events in late summer 2020. The Stadium is expected to welcome approximately one million visitors annually.Read more:Helsinki Olympic StadiumAn article

This year marks the 150th anniversary since the birth of Mahatma Gandhi (18691948), leader of Indias freedom struggle, who stood for values such as non-violence and peaceful coexistence. To honour the anniversary, the Government of India has presented a life-size statue portraying Mahatma Gandhi to the Government of Finland. The statue, which is located in Allotria Park (Allotrianpuisto), was unveiled on Friday 20 September.
The statue was unveiled by Dr. S. Jaishankar, Indias Minister of External Affairs, Mr Pekka Haavisto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, and Ms Pia Pakarinen, Deputy Mayor of the City of Helsinki.
  
The statue has been designed and made by the Indian sculptor Gautam Pal, whose numerous statues and busts of Mahatma Gandhi and other important figures of Indian history can be found in cities all over the world. The bronze statue is 185 cm tall and stands on a pedestal made of Finnish Baltic Brown granite.The statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Allotria Park was unveiled by Dr. S. Jaishankar, Indias Minister of External Affairs, Mr Pekka Haavisto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, and Ms Pia Pakarinen, Deputy Mayor of the City of Helsinki.Allotria Park is located by Hmeentie street. The park has its name from a cinema called Allotria that operated across the street in the 1950s and 1960s. Trees such as elm, lime and maple grow in the park. A special feature of this park are the impressive bare cliffs that comprise a wall and reach up to a few meters at their highest point. In the park, there is a flat lawn where it is possible to practice yoga. In the near future, a few benches will be added to the park, something that the locals have asked for.

Two local libraries in Helsinki are set to be renovated. Pitjnmki library will be closed for renovation from 30 September 2019 , and Palohein library will be closed from 7 October 2019. Both libraries will be reopened on Monday 18 November 2019. The interiors of the libraries will be refurbished and the facilities will be modernised. These renovations have been planned together with customers and staff.The goal of the functional renovation of the facilities of Pitjnmki and Palohein libraries is to make these premises not only better libraries, but attractive resident facilities that invite people in to participate and be inspired. The library is a space for culture and leisure, and it serves the users of the nearby sports facilities in Pitjnmki, for example, and inspires people to get together and organise events in Palohein, says Saara Ihamki, director of regional library services at Helsinki City Library. Both Pitjnmki and Palohein library are the only local public indoor spaces available to everyone. Neighbourhood libraries are important parts of the everyday lives of local people and services that strengthen well-being in the area by offering a free and safe public space. Libraries also increase the attractiveness of districts.During the renovation, both Pitjnmki and Palohein library materials will have longer than usual loan periods, and the materials may be returned to any Helmet library in Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen. However, reserved books are subject to the loan periods issued by the original library, which means that you should check the due date on your receipt or in the Taskukirjasto application.You should select another library as your local library from now on when making reservations. The closest libraries to Pitjnmki are located in Pohjois-Haaga, Kannelmki and Malminkartano. The closest libraries to Palohein library are located in Maunula, Oulunkyl and Pukinmki. The contact details for all Helmet libraries can be found athelmet.fi/libraries.

The City of Helsinki joins Plan Internationals Girls Takeover campaign, in which girls step into the shoes of political, social and economic leaders on the International Day of the Girl Child on 11 October, a day of observance declared by the UN.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori will step aside for a day on 11 October, to be replaced by 18-year-old Katariina Pekkonen. The one-day takeover is part of Plan Internationals campaign, which seeks to draw the attention of the world to the discrimination met by girls, and also to the enormous potential possessed by girls.Girls Takeover is now organized in Finland for the third time. Last year the girls of Plan International Childrens Board and a young Ugandan activist of Plan International successfully took over nine leadership positions. Globally, girls took over the offices of 2,000 leaders in 70 countries.This years campaign seeks to highlight especially the impact of climate change on girls in developing countries. Therefore the offices to be taken over comprise enterprises and organizations that can influence climate change mitigation with their actions.In addition to the Helsinki Mayors office, the offices to be taken over by girls comprise those of the following persons in leadership positions: Member of European Parliament Eero Heinluoma, Jukka Leskel, Managing Director of Finnish Energy, Tiina Alahuhta-Kasko, CEO of Marimekko, Olli Luukkainen, President of Trade Union of Education in Finland, Sara Mella, Nordeas Head of Personal Banking, Tapio Sadeoja, Senior Editor-in-Chief of Ilta-Sanomat,
  Emma Koivula, Editor-in-Chief of Anna magazine, and Saku Sipola, PresidentandCEOofSRVGroup Plc. In addition, a Cambodian activist of Plan International, Hory Toth, will take over the office of Krista Mikkonen, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.Mayor Vapaavuori says, One of the major issues of justice in our times is how to secure the rights of girls and young women. The takeover is in a good position to wake up people to think about the position and opportunities of girls in Finland and elsewhere in the world. The City of Helsinki continuously promotes gender equality with concrete action, for example, by fixing salaries and wages and through an equality project and plan. The International Day of the Girl Child is a grand way to celebrate our progress, but it also reminds us all that systematic work to promote equality has to be continued, also here in Finland and in Helsinki.The consequences of climate change will have negative impacts especially on girls in the poorest countries of the world. Climate change will weaken the nutrition, water supply and hygiene of girls, it will increase school dropout and child marriage rates, and it will increasingly expose girls to exploitation.However, girls in developing countries play significant roles in the climate solution. When girls are given opportunities for education and to participate in decision-making, their abilities and skills become part of the solution to the climate crisis. When girls can make decisions, the future is better for all of us.Climate change threatens to endanger the advances that we have already achieved in the rights of girls. Finland and the Finns must shoulder their fair share in the mitigation of climate change, and we can set an example to other nations with our action, says Ossi Heinnen, CEO of Plan International Finland.The purpose of the campaign is to give girls an opportunity genuinely and significantly to affect the decisions made during the day. For example, Ronja Holopainen stepped into the office of the President and CEO of Kesko Corporation last year, and as a result the corporation included the promotion and monitoring of gender equality in its responsibility criteria. This means that the corporation monitors tangibly, annually and in all parts of the world how gender equality progresses and develops in their partnering enterprises and procurement channels.Climate change mitigation is an important theme for me. Were not talking about climate and nature alone but about human rights. Equality and good preconditions for life despite ones background have always been important for me, and I feel that those are the exact things that I can impact with Girls Takeover, says Katariina, who will be replacing the Mayor of Helsinki.

Helsinki joins the EIT Urban Mobility foundation as a Member starting September 2019. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is an EU body created to strengthen Europes ability to innovate and support innovation partnerships.These Knowledge and Innovation Communities intensify the Europe-wide co-operation, for example, between cities and other actors. In its current phase, the EIT Urban Mobility KIC brings together 13 cities, 16 companies, 11 institutes of higher education and 7 research institutes around Europe.In 2018, the City of Helsinki participated and won as a part of the Mobilus consortium the EITs funding call for an urban traffic innovation community. In the Mobilus consortium, the City had 47 partners and since then, the work to create the judicial structure of the network has been performed during 2019 as a collaboration between the applicants. The Helsinki City Board decided about the membership at its meeting on 16 September. According to the Helsinki City Strategy, the entire City is developed as a platform for innovations and new experiments and for a creative business policy. Also line with the City Strategy, Helsinki wants to consolidate its international profile as a design metropolis and its position as an international forerunner in inclusion and transparency. Helsinki also strives to become a pioneer in overall functional smart traffic systems, and to be able to achieve this, Helsinki must build strategic partnerships with international players and other leading cities. The Urban Mobility KIC network is an excellent basis for furthering these goals.EIT Urban Mobility KIC will receive around EUR 399 million in EU funding over a time period of 7 years. As a member of the network, Helsinki can utilise the funding in its own development activities, in the research activities of the local institutes of higher education and in supporting the innovation activities of companies in the area.
The Skipperi city row boat service has provided people in Helsinki with no boats of their own an opportunity to go rowing over the summer months. The city row boat season will continue until the end of October, so anyone can go rowing, for example, to admire the autumn colours on Helsinki shorelines.Skipperi city row boats can be found at three locations: near Finlandia Hall at the Tl Bay in the Tlnlahti area, the boat point at the Aurinkolahti beach in Vuosaari, and Caf Torpanranta in Laajalahti, Munkkiniemi.A city row boat can be rented online and be used for three hours. The boat service charges a basic fee of 25 euros per season.The number of city row boats available for rent is approximately ten in 2019. The number of row boats should increase in 2020, and a fourth city row boat point is planned for Herttoniemi.The arrival of city row boats in Helsinki is part of the citys Maritime Strategy Project. The boats expand the maritime reach of Helsinki residents, and they encourage residents to use the city shorelines. At the same time, the service also supports the goals of Helsinkis physical activity programme.
Helsinkis Maritime Strategy provides guidelines for the development of the
offerings and appeal of the citys archipelago and waterfronts until 2030. The
goal with the strategy is to improve maritime services and the ease of access
to maritime destinations, to promote the organization of maritime events, and
to continue to open local islands for recreational uses.Read more:

The City of Helsinki is in the process of studying the feasibility of an expansion of the central pedestrian zone with the aim to improve the central business districts attractiveness and functionality and of constructing an underground distributor road to reduce traffic through the city centre and heavy street-level transport accessing the harbours. The central pedestrian zone and underground distributor road options that are to be presented to the Urban environment committee as deserving to be elaborated will be discussed at the committees meeting on 17 September 2019. 18.9.: Committee will again handle the matter in two weeks time. At this stage of planning, the preliminary impact assessments enable us to compare the ideas that have been brought forward with sufficient accuracy. However, we will be able to evaluate the feasibility of the project as a whole only later after having conducted wider assessments based on plans that are more detailed, asserts project manager Katariina Baarman, who is based at Helsinki City Executive Office.
 For instance, the more concrete general planning of the central pedestrian zone is just about to begin. Up until this moment, we have examined issues only on a general level, but we have not yet mulled over what tangible measures to take in this or that spot in specific streets, Baarman says.The seven idea-stage alternatives for the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the construction of an underground distributor road have subsequent to municipal studies been moulded into a proposed basis for the further planning of the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the construction of an underground distributor road.The general planning of the central pedestrian zone is intended to start based on functional considerations. As for the central pedestrian zone, Kaivokatu has in the studies so far been assumed to be a transit mall. Concerning Pohjois- and Etelesplanadi, two options have been studied.The first option is based on both Pohjois- and Etelesplanadi being single-lane streets, meaning that the pavement as a rule may be widened by the width of one traffic lane, whereby the Esplanade streets would remain symmetrical relative to the park. The second option assumes that there would be a unified and, compared to the current situation, clearly larger area of pedestrian streets, as Pohjoisesplanadi would serve as a pedestrian street, while Etelesplanadi would be a 1+1 two-way street.The main tunnel of the underground distributor road is planned to be constructed from Lnsivyl to Hermannin rantatie to become mainly a 2+2 lane road with the objective of making it safe and having it last long into the future, also serving traffic to and from the harbours.
The planning of the underground distributor road should clarify the following items:The Urban environment committee will begin deliberating the plans at its meeting on 17 September. The meeting agenda will be published on 13 September and be made available on hel.fi/kaupunkiymparistolautakuntaAn information meeting for the city residents regarding the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the underground distributor road will take place 25 September 2019 at 56:30 p.m. at the City Hall event square.Further information:The Helsinki New Horizons web pagesInformation meeting for the city residents on 25 September (The event on Facebook)
SSA Group Oy begins the construction of new Hitas homes in the Koskela Hospital area in early September. Street construction and infrastructure development are also under way in the area.The Koskela Multi-service Centre and other social and health care services in the area will continue to serve as normal despite the construction project. One of the services operating in the area is self-care supplies distribution.Pedestrian routes in the area will stay unchanged for the time being, but as construction work proceeds, new routes will be built. There will be clear signs indicating new routes and to guide area users.For the time being, customers can park on the short-term parking spaces located at the main gate on Kpylntie. Parking spaces in front of the Multi-service Centre will also remain in use. Customers can no longer drive from Koskelantie to the hospital area.Buses continue to serve the area as normal. However, construction sites may slow traffic on Koskelantie and other streets.Residential construction in the Koskela Hospital area begins from Kpylntie 11. The area, which is the former home of the famed hospital park, will have more than 1,500 new homes for 3,000 residents.The first two multi-storey apartment buildings, with 66 Hitas homes, will be built by SSA Group Oy. The popularity of the area is evident by the fact that the homes about to go under construction have already been sold.he area will have several housing types, including Hitas homes (that is, price-regulated owner-occupied homes), right-of-occupancy homes, rental homes, housing cooperative homes and senior homes. Some buildings will have street-level business space. The new homes will be located at the edges of the Koskela Hospital area, encircling much of the old hospital park, which will be preserved. The old hospital buildings, protected in the areas detailed plan, will be converted into homes later on, and one of the buildings to be renovated will house day care space. A new multi-service centre is scheduled for completion in 2023.Large-scale residential construction requires new streets and infrastructure. Street construction and infrastructure development went under way in spring 2019. All construction work is planned and proceeds so that the Koskela Hospital area can remain in its normal, busy use, with only temporary disruption from construction.

Helsinki is actively bolstering its international reputation together with local companies in the technology sector. A new marketing campaign is being launched in September to test what type of image could attract international talent to move permanently to Helsinki.Although Helsinki already performs well in international city rankings, attracting international talent to Finland remains a challenge according to the experience of local companies.Finnish growth companies are among the leaders in Europe in attracting investments, and hundreds of millions of euros in foreign capital have been invested in startups here. One of the barriers to their growth, however, is attracting talent. Helsinki wants to improve the citys image as a place to live. I believe this is possible, as the majority of foreign experts who have settled in Helsinki are satisfied with the quality of life here, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Helsinki is stepping up its collaboration with companies in the technology sector to bolster its international reputation. Partners in the initial stage include Supercell, Smartly, Relex and MaaS Global, as well as the startup event Slush. A commonly recognised reason for the relatively low volume of newcomers is a lack of international awareness of Helsinki. Perceptions of the Finnish capital are both weak and somewhat outdated.Finding the best talent in the world is critical for us. Helsinki is a fine city, but the threshold for coming here to check it out, let alone move here, is high. Weve noticed that, when we do get the people we are trying to recruit to experience Helsinki for themselves, their enthusiasm ignites and they are more likely to sign an employment contract, says Kristo Ovaska, CEO of Smartly. Helsinkis prospects as a potential new hometown will be tested by 15 possible recruits at the next Slush startup event. A joint marketing campaign entitled CaaS  Worlds first City as a Service is being launched this September by Helsinki Marketing, the city-owned company responsible for the citys marketing operations, together with local technology companies. The aim of the campaign is to engage international technology experts in a surprising and distinctive way. Digital marketing will focus initially on the cities of St. Petersburg, Krakow and London.Its wonderful to see how Helsinki is seeking bold new initiatives in terms of international marketing. The target group will be addressed in their own native languages. You cannot attract attention by doing things the same way as others, says Andreas Saari, CEO of Slush.International House Helsinki (IHH) offers fast and comprehensive services to foreign experts settling in Helsinki. IHH plays an important role in offering advisory services to both foreign experts arriving in Helsinki and the local companies and employers who are recruiting them. Since it opened in December 2017, IHH has offered the majority of advisory and official services required by newcomers under one roof in the Srninen district of Helsinki. IHH also helps companies and employers in issues related to recruiting foreign labour.Together with its neighbouring municipalities of Espoo and Vantaa, Helsinki is also participating in the Finnish Governments cross-administrative Talent Boost  International Talents Boosting Growth initiative. Within this framework, Helsinki is working in close collaboration with the State, universities and other local and regional actors to attract a skilled workforce. The aim is also to support employment opportunities for foreign experts who already live here, such as university students.Visit the campaign websiteView the campaign video
The City of Helsinki has opened a survey to encourage anyone interested in developing roadworks to share their experiences and ideas. Additionally, the City has launched a new website.Helsinki started a project to reduce nuisance caused by roadworks earlier this year. The aim is to make the execution of roadworks smoother and faster and to improve the ways in which information about them is provided to residents.The City is looking for new solutions to reduce the impact of roadworks on the lives of residents and make transportation around construction sites easier and safer. Helsinki invites anyone interested in improving roadworks to participate. As of today, residents and those visiting Helsinki can fill out a survey about their experiences regarding roadworks.We want to know how you feel about commuting or walking near roadworks sites, whether temporary signs are functional, whether work sites seem safe and orderly and whether residents have any ideas on how communications about roadworks could be improved, says Communications Manager Heikki Mntymki from the Urban Environment Division.The City is utilising service design to improve experiences around worksites. The City of Helsinki is conducting work site experience development together with Pentagon Design. The online survey has been published on the brand new website.You can also use the site to monitor the progress of the roadworks improvement project. It contains comprehensive information on ongoing roadworks as well as relevant links.Go to the improving roadworks websiteTake the survey

Photo: Miguel Sanz Castedo, Madrids regional director of tourism, explored Lonna Island wearing a virtual reality headset.Helsinki has hosted an important tourism industry event, the annual meeting of the international World Tourism Cities Federation (WTCF) network. The event attracted about 500 international participants. A large share of them were Chinese.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori is pleased with the fact that it was possible to have the network meeting take place in Helsinki. The city gained visibility and Helsinkian tourism businesses were able to show off their services. Only less than 10 per cent of the Chinese own a passport. The tourism potential is enormous, and it is terrific that we are able to assert Helsinki so well from the viewpoint of tourism, Vapaavuori said.According to a visitor survey by Visit Finland, specifically the Chinese are the tourists who spend the most money. In the last five years, the Chinese doubled their volume of overnight stays at accommodations in Helsinki.Vapaavuori thinks that Helsinki and Finland have better learned to understand the wishes and needs of Chinese tourists.
Jan Vapaavuori reiterates that Helsinki has been a pioneer of the Asian tourism market. The first commercial flight from China to Europe was the route between Beijing and Helsinki.

Laura Aalto, CEO of the Helsinki Marketing city marketing company, is on her part happy about the fact that it was possible to make sustainable tourism and the effort to develop it the themes of the international event. We here in Helsinki have fared well winning the European Capital of Smart Tourism 2019 competition is already a sign of that. We won it together with Lyon.
Laura Aalto is convinced that during the Helsinki event the cooperation with the international network became yet closer and was raised to a new level.

Aalto thinks that it is important for Helsinki to be able to disseminate its ideas and talk about what it is doing for sustainable tourism. The Think Sustainably web service on the MyHelsinki.fi pages was put online this summer and has attracted international attention.The role of the cities as trendsetters for developing tourism and the great importance of cooperation were topics that were pointedly present in the addresses during the event. Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Klvart, who talked about Talsinki comprising Helsinki and Tallinn, was one case in point. Cooperation brings success. Together, Tallinn and Helsinki are bigger and have a greater impact, Klvart asserts.
Tallinn joined the WTCF network last year. Mayor Mihhail Klvart, centre, poses together with the representatives of the cities that joined the network this year.

WTCF secretary-general Song Yu used statistics to introduce the importance of tourism. Last year, more than 1.3 billion trips abroad were made, and journeys made by Chinese rose in particular.He underlined smartness as a growing trend in tourism and emphasised that tourism that stresses smart solutions does not evolve without a strong input from cities.Professor Li Yuonpeng, an expert at WTCF, talked about a report for which Chinese travellers had been asked about their expectations concerning the travel destination. Smart apps are among the prerequisites. Guidebooks, tickets and payment services should be digital. Working Wi-Fi connections on location are important.Present were also companies that produce smart solutions. Kaj Pyyhti, who represented the MaaS Global company that has developed the Whim mobility app, points out that tourism is turning increasingly individual. Tourists want to experience the kind of things that the locals do and know what the locals favour themselves.It is a big advantage when also individual tourism is safe and easy and when practical matters may be handled using an app on the phone.Pyyhti commended the City of Helsinki on being a pioneer of open data. By opening up its data, the municipality generates opportunities for partners to create new services.
Kaj Pyyhti says that even Chinese tourism is becoming increasingly individual.

At Finlandia Hall, cities that are part of the network had a chance to present their respective assets. There was a line to Helsinkis stand, since people were there able to try virtual reality headsets and as-it-were visit a Finnish-style furnished home and Lonna Island as it appears in the summer and in the winter.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, director of economic development, said that a big plus for Helsinki that helps it attract international travellers is, among other things, the clean air and the compact size of the city. Helsinki is for many foreigners an astonishing experience. You travel only twenty minutes from the city centre and you will find yourself deep in the forest landscape or out at sea completely at peace.She hoped that a genuine spirit of Helsinki would be transmitted to the participants of the event.
Marja-Leena Rinkineva hopes that the international crowd of participants will carry with them a memorable experience.

This is what actually happened, at the very least in the words of WTCF assistant secretary Li Baochun. He visited Helsinki for the first time in the 1990s.
Li Baochun predicts that in the future Chinese travellers will stay in Helsinki for even longer periods. The city is friendly and its services are of high quality.

His accolades for the city amounted to a small lecture. Among other things, he praised the beauty of the city, the diversity of its culture, its suitability and facilities for winter sports, its technological skills, its good connections and the friendliness of the Helsinkians.Original text in Finnish: Kirsi RiipinenPhotos: Ilkka Ranta-ahoMore informationWorld Tourism Cities Federation 2019 SummitMy Helsinki  Think Sustainably

The City of Helsinki is implementing changes in the traffic arrangements at the intersection of Tyynenmerenkatu and Rionkatu. The roadworks, which start in September, will cause disruptions to traffic. After the roadworks have been completed, heavy traffic to and from West Harbour will be directed to Tyynenmerenkatu.
Heavy traffic to and from the harbour is to be directed to the Rionkatu intersection to improve road safety and minimise nuisance to local residents. This change allows heavy vehicles to queue for vessels in the contained harbour area. Heavy traffic to and from West Harbour is to be directed away from Atlantinkatu and Lnsisatamankatu, which are residential streets. These traffic arrangements are also necessary due to the construction of the Atlantinsilta.A roundabout will be constructed at the Tyynenmerenkatu and Rionkatu intersection. The pedestrian crossings across Tyynenmerenkatu will be removed near Rionkatu, and the traffic lights will be removed from the intersection. The nearest pedestrian crossings are located approximately 80 metres north and approximately 100 metres south towards the terminal in the harbour.Impact on traffic during the worksMotor vehicles: Routes will be secured. Pedestrians and cyclists: The walking and cycling route on Tyynenmerenkatu as well as the route along Jtksaarenlaituri will be closed. Pedestrians and cyclists will be directed to a route running along Hietasaarenkuja.Public transportation: no impact.The works are scheduled for completion by end of this year.

Finnish startup campus Maria 01, owned by the owners of the Nordics biggest startup conference Slush, City of Helsinki and Helsinki Enterprise Agency, has begun the expansion to become Europes largest growth company campus. The campus will expand from its current 10,000 sq m space to 70,000 sq m by 2023 and will be led by new CEO Ville Simola. The future campus will attract approximately 650 new operators and new jobs for at least 4,000 people.Built at a former hospital complex in downtown Helsinki, Maria 01 is a non-profit campus and home to over 120 startups and scale-ups, 12 venture capital funds, several ecosystem supporters, and over 1,100 members making it currently the biggest startup cluster in the Nordics. Maria 01s diverse network, first-rate conditions for innovation, and immediate location next to capital offer a perfect formula to help startups grow and expand.Not content with being the largest in the Nordics, new CEO Ville Simola has his eyes set on an even bigger target by making the hub the biggest in Europe after the new expansion.Im excited to take up the reins of this ambitious project which is sure to change the Finnish startup scene today as we know it. I see a lot of challenges in the expansion but Im no stranger to ecosystem building after my work with Startup Sauna, explains Maria 01 CEO Ville Simola, whose previous work saw him co-found and grow the internationally recognized premier startup accelerator Startup Sauna before venturing into the corporate world.Each and every company Maria 01 takes under its roof is chosen using strict criteria and is expected to move out after 3 years to make room for new startups and scaling companies.The Nordics are now challenging the established large European hubs and Finnish startups are sprouting faster than ever. Currently, only 16% of the startups who apply to work at Maria 01 are accepted so the new, larger space will help us to meet the increasing demand for our curated community while bringing new jobs to the area meaning huge benefits for the community, startups, city, and economy, continues Simola.Maria 01 is set to open a new wing of the former hospital in October 2019 under a previous agreement that will see the space double in size to 20,000 sq m ahead of the new 50,000 sq m expansion set to be completed by 2023. The expansion consortium will be led by YIT and Keva together with the City of Helsinki.Additional information
 Under the new plans, the hub will expand to 70,000 sq m by 2023, making it the largest startup campus in Europe. The campus currently plays home to 12 venture capital funds including Play Ventures and Inventure, with 1.8 billion combined assets under management and over 120 startups who have raised a combined 154M. According to data from the Finnish Venture Capital Association, Finnish startups attract the most venture capital in Europe relative to GDP.Contact informationHead of Unit Santtu von Bruun, City Executive Office, Economic Development, Innovations and New Experiments Unit, tel. +358 (0)40 357 7452, e-mail: santtu.vonbruun(at)hel.fi

Smart Mobility projects of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences have introduced robot buses to the streets of Helsinki in residential areas of Kalasatama and Aurinkolahti. The pilot route 90R has attracted the curious passengers with over 2000 visitors taking a ride in less than three months.As part of the pilot in Helsinki, the participants were able to give feedback by filling an on-board passenger survey. Sami Mkinen from FLOU has analyzed these survey results.
Most of the users have been first-timers, and nearly all of them felt the ride was both safe and secure, Mkinen points out.
The pilot and the survey have reached a wide audience and especially people over 60 have been eager to participate in the pilot. The reasons for choosing a robot bus over the other transportation options were bad weather and carrying heavy items. The respondents believed they could also use robot buses as part of their daily commuting journey.
  

For us to reach the traffic emission reduction goals, the change must happen within the daily routines of our citizens. Leaving your car home requires that there is a wide range of, and above all public, transport services available. The automated public transportation provides a better service level and user experience for wider clientele, reminds project manager Jari Honkonen from Forum Virium Helsinki.
  
The pilot in Vuosaari ends in September 2019, but the Sohjoa Baltic project continues in Tallinn, Estonia.Read more:Forum Virium
A new home for Extended Reality, Helsinki XR Center (HXRC), opened in the Arabianranta district of Helsinki in the spring of 2019. HXRC celebrates its Grand Opening on Thursday, 5 September.

City of Helsinki office buildings in Hakaniemi, located at the junction of Toinen linja and Siltasaarenkatu, will be demolished for new construction comprising varied non-residential spaces and homes. The current buildings are outdated for office use both in terms of building technology and operationally.The demolition and development were approved by the Helsinki City Council at its meeting of 28 August 2019.The demolition is made possible by the City Councilapproved alteration to the detailed plan for the site of Siltasaarenportti at the junction of Siltasaarenkatu, Porthaninkatu and Toinen linja.
The Helsinki City Council had approved a plan named Lyyra for the site of Siltasaarenportti in the autumn of 2018. The plan, produced by the Student Union of the University of Helsinki, was the winner of an implementation competition based on the site plan.The block to be built on the basis of the Lyyra plan will give the area more street-level business space, which is typical of the local Kallio district, as well as new non-residential space and housing. The winning plan will help create a dynamic city environment around the site, and it allows the Siltasaarenkatu pedestrian street to evolve, comments Anni Sinnemki, Helsinki Deputy Mayor for Urban Environment.The City Council approved the raising of the price ceiling for the renovation of Ressu Upper Secondary School by 5.3 million euros. The price ceiling is set in the renovation project plan. The new price ceiling for the renovation project is 23,004,370 euros.The Ressu Upper Secondary School building on Kalevankatu has served as a school building since 1892. The school was expanded to the adjacent site in 19121914. The building is significant both architecturally and in term of the Helsinki cityscape. It cannot be demolished, and no such demolition or alterations can be carried out in the building that would destroy or compromise the architectural value and style of the building exteriors facing the street and the park, the rooftops or the interior. Renovation work was commenced in January 2018. Over the course of the project, such significant needs for additional work and alterations have emerged that raise the costs of the renovation.The City Council also approved the raising of the price ceiling for the renovation of the Swedish-language comprehensive school Botby grundskolan and the price ceiling for the Jtksaari Comprehensive School included in that schools project plan.The Tahvonlahti primary school building will be renovated with approximately 27 million euros. The planned renovation of the school building, which dates back to the 1970s, involves both operations and building technology, and it includes an expansion that will house Day Care Centre Tahvonlahti.The current day care centre building located at the adjacent site will be demolished upon the completion of the renovation project. The school building will comply with the educational objectives of open learning environments. The renovation is scheduled for completion in June 2022. The number of comprehensive-school-aged children in the Tahvonlahti school district will grow as the construction of the Kruunuvuorenranta housing community proceeds. The renovation will increase the capacity of the Tahvonlahti school by 230 to around 500 students.The City of Helsinki sells its holding in the Lasipalatsi property to Mercator Fastigheter Ab.

The population of Helsinki exceeded the 650,000-inhabitant threshold in the summer. According to preliminary information by Statistics Finland, the population of Helsinki was 651,495 at the end of July.However, the population growth, 3,453 inhabitants, was slower than last year.Espoo and Vantaa have grown faster than before in JanuaryJuly. Thus, the growth of the entire Metropolitan Area, 10,543 inhabitants, was faster than ever during this century, even though the number of births decreased by almost 300 in the Metropolitan Area.In January, the Metropolitan Area had a net immigration of 8,547 persons, of which half was domestic and the other half from abroad.In July, the population of the 14 municipalities in the Helsinki Region exceeded 1.5 million. in JanuaryJuly, almost half of the growth in the Helsinki Region, 45 %, came from domestic net immigration, 37 % from abroad and 18 % from natural population growth.Statistics FinlandStatistics and research in Helsinki
The City of Helsinki challenges enterprises to develop new types of IoT (Internet of Things) solutions and to test them at the Ressu Comprehensive School property. The goal is to help enterprises to develop new means to produce added value for real estate owners, managers and users with solutions that utilize the IoT technology.
The Ressu Comprehensive School uses an IoT system that gathers occupancy data on nearly all learning environments of the school at five-minute intervals. In addition, sensors measure the temperature, lighting levels and humidity at these environments. The measurement data is visualized to the school staff in a report that shows available spaces almost in real time. The data on usage rates is reported to management, in order for them to form a picture of the sufficiency of the school facilities for the current number of users and current uses.Our goal has been to produce data on occupancy and usage rates for the purposes of the innovation competition, as it seems that school facilities are in busy use  especially in city centres. Thus there is big business potential for solutions that enable smarter use of space, both in Finland and internationally, says the competition leader Raigo Megerild of the City of Helsinki Economic Development division.However, the innovations entered into the competition do not have to be directly related to the use of space. It is enough that the proposed solutions utilize a part of the current system. So the innovations for the competition can involve enrichment of data, user interface development or development of sensor accuracy, as long as they are intended to produce added value for customers. The City of Helsinki has allocated 20,000 euros for the implementation of pilots.All in all, data is gathered on more than 40 learning environments. The system goes into operation in September 2019, and the pilots of the innovation competition will be carried out during the school year 20192020, Megerild explains.The IoT smart school system of Ressu was delivered by Aureolis Oy in cooperation with Viria Security Oy.
According to the Helsinki City Strategy, Helsinki is developed through activities in which the whole city serves as a platform for experiments and innovative business. Helsinki advances the creation of a new business ecosystem of experimentation in cooperation with various actors including enterprises. The Citys goal is to become the leading platform for experimentation in Europe by 2025. This goal is pursued in the education sector by opening the city as a platform in the project by 6Aika  Six City Strategy  titled Smart Learning Environments for the Future. The innovation competition is a part of the project.

The committee that had been tasked with considering the corporatisation of Helsinki City Transport has published its report. The committee has concluded that HKL will not be able to meet the pressures for change in the operational environment as long as it remains a public utility and recommends hence that the ownership model should be altered from public utility to public company.The committee recognised several key forces of change that have an impact on how HKL should be organised, e.g. the increasing role of rail transport in urban development, several new regional rail projects that are being planned and that will be linked up with Helsinkis inner city network as well as rail transport becoming more market-determined, and possible decisions about inviting tenders for transport that has been managed by Helsinki Region Transport (HSL).The committee proposes that the entire HKL should be turned into HKL Ltd. (HKL Oy) on 1 July 2020 at the earliest. HKL Ltd. is the starting point for further development towards an operations model that will enable and support a regional approach, whose prerequisite is the participation of also the regions other local authorities in the planning and execution of rail transport service solutions. The committee proposes that the transformation into a public company from an administrative point of view should be carried as a transfer of business where HKLs personnel are transferred into the new company as so-called old employees.There are several rail transport projects that are either underway or will be launched in the upcoming years. This is positive from the point of view of more sustainable and smoothly-operating urban traffic. The operational environment also changes, as some of the new projects are regional undertakings that straddle the city boundaries. From the citys viewpoint it is essential to make sure that we will be able to measure up to the forthcoming changes and to cope with them well, and to guarantee the city residents well-running communications. Consequently, this autumn we have to consider carefully the HKLs organisational status too as part of the whole. There is reason to discuss the item at a regional level as well, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.It is essential to make sure that HKL is well poised for participating in the development of urban rail transport. As the transport system evolves, the task area of rail transport will expand, and in that case, HKLs expertise will be of value. At the same time, present and future personnel will have the opportunity to carry out duties that are motivational and future-oriented, Deputy Mayor Anni Sinnemki comments.On 24 January 2019, the City of Helsinki appointed a committee to look into the issue of transforming the public transport utility into a public company while taking into consideration previous reports on organisational changes, changes in the operational environment, both passed and those that are on the horizon, and the development of competitive tendering of public transport. The committee was tasked with preparing a proposal for the transformation of HKL into a public company, if justified.According to the committee, the strengths of operating as a public company are, among others: the company structure enables, when under efficient leadership, the improvement of productivity and operations, the model offers flexibility as for the planning of the investments, the funding and the operational economy, and it also increases transparency and target-orientation, the large HKL complex that supports synergies and maintains the knowledge cluster will be preserved, the model makes it possible to retain regional rail transport infrastructure and materiel in the hands of one player. This, however, requires the local authorities of the region and HSL to go along with it, the model enables further development of the company in the future, and, for instance, dividing it in order to advance regional solutions.Further reading:HKL, final report, 6 June 2019 (pdf)The City Managers resolution
Tiivistm is a place that offers inspiring cultural and artistic experiences, as well as the opportunity to organise events in high-quality and adaptable settings. Consequently, the autumn programme will feature events such as concerts, clubs, dance events and small-scale festivals. Yung Gravy, whose popularity is on a rising trajectory, will perform at Tiivistm in November, marking the American rappers first performance in Finland.- Its great that a new facility for events was found in Suvilahti of all places. The City of Helsinkis strategic policy is to develop the area into an internationally distinctive, permanent event area, and locating Tiivistm, which is maintained by the Citys Youth Services, in the area supports this goal well, says Local Youth Work Manager Pekka Mnttinen happily.Tiivistm will carry the torch of the Gloria Cultural Arena, which closed its doors in March, and the opening of Tiivistm will provide Suvilahti with year-round activities and more visitors. The programme production will be carried out primarily in co-operation with various communities, event organisers and artists. The events will be targeted especially at young people and young adults. In addition to events, Tiivistm will provide event production-related internships for numerous young people interested in the field. Tiivistm will be opened at the Planet Suvilahti event on 21 September. The event will usher all of Suvilahti into an autumnal atmosphere of experiences, providing plenty of things to see and do for children, young people and adults alike. The opening day will also kick off Tiivistms first theme month: the Flowers of Life deco collective and video artist Matlock Visuals are designing an unprecedented installation combining light and video for the opening month. Over the course of the month, all events at Tiivistm will take place within the three-dimensional world of this work.
Children of immigrants in the Capital Region are on average less likely to hold an upper secondary level degree, when compared to children of natives. However, when comparing children of immigrants who were born in Finland with children of natives with a similar family background and neighbourhoods, no educational differences are observed. This is the outcome of Helsinki City Executive Office Special Researcher Laura Ansala's fresh article in urban research web magazine Kvartti.On average, the differences in education between immigrants children and children of natives are considerable in the Capital Region. However, the educational attainment of immigrants children does vary a lot between children who have come to Finland at different ages and from different areas, notes Researcher Laura Ansala in her article.Another thing that should be considered in the comparison is the difference in the socio-economic status and neighbourhoods between families with an immigrant background and families with a Finnish background.
The picture of the educational attainment of immigrants children changes considerably, when they are compared to children of natives, who have been raised in similar families in terms of income, employment and household structure and in the same postal code areas. In the Capital Region, children of immigrants who are born in Finland are on average at least as likely to hold an upper secondary level degree by the age of 23 as children of natives growing up in similar families and neighbourhoods.
Childrens
age at arrival affects educational attainmentHowever, children of immigrants who have arrived in Finland as children or teenagers are still less likely to hold an upper secondary level degree, when compared to children of immigrants who are born in Finland.There are several factors that may contribute to this. For example, moving to Finland before the age critical to learning a language or the time spent in Finland by the parents could improve childrens educational attainment, analyses Ansala.Even though alternative explanations may not be ruled out entirely based on the analysis, the significance of the age of arrival is most likely explained by the time that the children spend in the Finnish society.Hence, those children of immigrants who come to Finland during childhood could benefit from interventions that target their specific needs. The analysis of the Kvartti article is based on a study by Ansala et al. (2019), which examines the educational attainment and coping of immigrants children on the Finnish national level. The results concerning educational attainment from the Capital Region and entire Finland are qualitatively congruent with each other.Publications: Laura Ansala: Maahanmuuttajien lasten ja

The 2019 annual meeting of World Tourism Cities Federation (WTCF) is to take place on 34 September in Helsinki. Helsinki will host the meeting for the first time. About 500 participants from China and other parts of the world are expected to Finlandia Hall.Established in 2012 in Beijing, the aim of WTCF is to offer a platform for international tourism cooperation and sustainable development of tourism. Helsinki joined the WTCF network in 2014. Beijing and Helsinki have been sister cities since 2006.The annual meeting will get wide media exposure in China and hence it is an excellent opportunity to introduce Helsinki to Chinese tourists and to get insights into the Chinese tour operators views on where the tourism industry is evolving.Helsinki is a pioneer of tourism from Asia and our cooperation with Chinese tourism industry players has attracted international attention. Acting as host for the WTCF network provides us with the opportunity to raise themes like responsibility and digitisation into the centre of the debate. Moreover, the meeting enables local tourism industry players to build relationships with Chinese players and to further develop what Helsinki has to offer as a tourist resort, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The meeting brings a large number of high-ranking civil servants and key influencers and players of the tourism industry, including 18 Chinese tour operators, to Helsinki. About 20 Helsinkian tourism industry companies present their offerings to the tour operators at a workshop taking place at Finlandia Hall.The significance of cities is continuously growing also in tourism and therefore it is important for Helsinki to be part of this intercity network. Helsinki was confirmed as the host city of the WTCF annual meeting at the annual meeting that took place in Los Angeles on 19 September 2017, when also Tencent, a major Chinese company, and the City of Helsinki announced their partnership concerning the WeChat application. The new mini application, which is aimed at almost one billion WeChat users, is useful to e.g. tourists.For Helsinki, the WTCF membership opened up new opportunities for cooperation in China. The WeChat partnership offers Helsinki a significant digital kick-off with respect to the development of services aimed at Chinese travellers. This has been noticed around the world as well, and there are people who keep a close eye on Helsinkis moves, asserts Helsinki Marketing CEO Laura Aalto.The City of Helsinki has partnered with Finnair, Finavia, Visit Finland, Tallink Silja, Visit Tallinn and Helsinki Distilling Company as co-arrangers of the WTCF annual meeting.One of the objectives of WTCF, besides promoting international cooperation within tourism, is to provide a platform for the sustainable development of tourism. The theme of the 2019 annual meeting is Smart Tourism  Road to City Innovation and Development. The programme of the meeting tackles, among other things, responsible tourism and technological innovations, trends in tourist flows globally, the importance of cultural values and tourism marketing.Helsinki, being a member of the network, plays an important role as a trendsetter. Helsinki and Lyon finished in a joint top spot in the EUs new European Capital of Smart Tourism Competition 2019. Helsinki tourism has drawn up a plan of action that taps into the citys status as European tourism capital this year, and Helsinkis Roadmap for Tourism 20182021 will be complemented with a sustainable tourism programme, due for completion this year.In addition, the new Think Sustainably online service at MyHelsinki.fi assists people in finding more sustainable ways to live and have a good time in Helsinki. The version that was launched in June 2019 is a pilot that will be improved in future. The service is founded on criteria for increasingly responsible choices. These criteria, which are tailored-made for Helsinki, have been compiled jointly by the Demos Helsinki think-tank, local stakeholders and responsibility experts.The registered overnight stays of Chinese travellers at the accommodation businesses in Helsinki have more than doubled over the last five years. In the period between January and June this year there has been a growth of almost 2 per cent.The increase in the number of Chinese tourists has been supported by Finnair's strong Asia strategy, owing to which the air service between Helsinki and China is excellent.More informationWorld Tourism Cities FederationTencentMy Helsinki  Think Sustainably serviceHelsinki  European Capital of Smart Tourism 2019

The preparatory work that was launched jointly with the Helsinkians at the end of 2018 has been completed save the voting.The preparatory stage of the participatory budgeting proposals has been completed.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori has confirmed the list of OmaStadi budget proposals that advance to voting based on development work that has been carried out jointly by the residents and by municipal experts.Helsinki is the first city in the world to have extended participatory budgeting to such large swaths of the municipal divisions. We are pioneers also due to the fact that we enable even 12-year-olds to vote for the proposals. To enable participation and doing-it-yourself is an essential part of Helsinki, asserts Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.In October, the Helsinkians will have the chance to vote for the proposals that are to advance to implementation. The voting will take place using the omastadi.hel.fi platform. To be able to vote you are required to provide strong electronic identification by means of mobile ID or banking codes. Those who are unable to use electronic identification may vote at libraries, resident houses and the comprehensive service centres. That being the case, you may use your ID card or passport to identify yourself.The Helsinkians were in the autumn of 2018 invited for the first time to brainstorm about what to do with 4.4 million euros. The City received almost 1,300 submissions out of which a little more than 800 were deemed viable. Last spring, the inhabitants and experts from the municipality worked together at OmaStadi Raksa workshops and via the omastadi.hel.fi platform to refine the ideas and turn them into plans. During the summer, price tags were calculated for the plans. As a result of the joint planning, more than 300 plans were drawn up and estimates of the implementation costs were issued.OmaStadi plans include increasing the number of parks, sports and hobby venues, communal premises and eventsThe plans that are put forward to a vote represent the Helsinkians ideas from A to Z. Most plans involved improving the city environment, such as increasing the number of outdoor sports venues and refurbishing parks and beach areas. Plans were also made for communal resident venues and the joint use of venues in various parts of the city.The first season of participatory budgeting has been one of learning and experimenting new things, as always is the case when doing something for the first time. It has been inspiring to learn how committed people have been to the process, says Kirsi Verkka, who is head of development.After the vote, the City will start implementing the ideas that were successful among the voters. The city residents will also be invited to participate in the preparation and the actual execution of the plans that are to be implemented.Further info:OmaStadi site Participation and Interaction ModelThe Mayors resolutions

Trunk route 510 went into service between Westendinasema in Espoo and Herttoniemi in eastern Helsinki on Monday, 12 August. In the first weeks of service, buses on the route will bear other colours than the regular orange-and-white of trunk route buses. All buses on the route will be orange-and-white by the end of September.Trunk route 510 will be served by 24 new buses, but not all of them were available when the route went into service, due to the fleet suppliers production difficulties. The route operator compensates for the fleet shortage with 9 older buses, which have been in service in the region. For example, buses on route 510 may bear the blue-and-white colours of the customer Helsinki Region Transport HSL, and the Concordia colours of Nobina.Nobina will replace the older buses with new ones as soon as the new buses are delivered. The company estimates that all buses on route 510 will be orange-and-white no later than the end of September.All buses serving the route, both the new ones and the older ones, are low-floor buses with a bogie frame. Because 510 is a trunk route, the buses on the route can be boarded through the middle doors, no matter what the colours of the particular bus are. It is not necessary to show a valid ticket to a card reader or the driver.The older buses on the route do not have a card reader at the middle doors, so if you need to show your HSL travel card to a card reader, for example, to charge a fare, you must do so with the card reader placed at the front doors.The trunk route network of Helsinki Region Transport HSL expanded with two new bus routes on 12 August, when route 58 was converted into trunk route 500 and route 551 into trunk route 510. The timetables and routes of the buses did not change, as they had operated with trunk-route frequencies, but the number of stops served have been reduced to speed up journey times.Read more from HSL:Bus

UN Social Impact Investing Initiative opens new office in Helsinki. The relocation of the UNOPS S3I initiative to Helsinki adds to the UN presence in Finland.
An agreement was signed on 12 August by Minister for Development Cooperation and ForeignVille Skinnari and UNOPS Executive Director Grete Faremo.
  
The Social Impact Investing Initiative (S3I) of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is a programme for promoting the UNs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing countries. Opening its new office in Helsinki, the S3I initiative will focus on major infrastructure projects in three sectors: renewable energy, affordable housing, and health. It will operate as project developer, making projects suitable for investment and attracting private investor finance. Impact investing means responsible investment in which the investor aims not only to make a return but to generate a social impact.
The City is part of this process of enabling UNOPS to move its S3I operations, and in this concrete way we want to foster the image of Helsinki as a city that is internationally networked and provides a great operating environment for global organisations. The S3I initiative is of global importance and also supports Helsinkis goal of a more significant role for cities in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, says Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori.The relocation of the UNOPS S3I initiative to Helsinki adds to the UN presence in Finland: Helsinki already has the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER), and Otaniemi in Espoo is home to the UN Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL).
The S3I office will be located in Sofia Future Farm in the heart of Helsinki. More information:UNOPSPress release

The construction of Urhea Campus is now underway at the Mkelnrinne Upper Secondary School, which has a special focus on sports. The campus will consist of a multiple sports training hall, a new apartment building to house students and the school building, which will be renovated and expanded. An expansion is proposed for the Mkelnrinne Swimming Centre located at the campus.The new campus will give Mkelnrinne students better conditions, as they will be able to train, study, have their meals and live in one place. Sports training will be supported with healthcare services, coaching and research. The Upper Secondary School expansion, the sports hall and Hoas student housing will be linked with indoor connections.The multiple sports hall will give 14,000 square metres of new training facilities to the Urhea Academys athletes and to local sports clubs. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Sports Academy Urhea has close to 5,000 member athletes.The Urhea hall will have a large general and weight training area, halls with mirrors, and halls for mens and womens gymnastics, track and field, judo and wrestling, rhythmic gymnastics and basketball.In addition, we have plans for a physical therapy, rehabilitation and recovery centre, a sports healthcare and testing station, and office space. The campus will accommodate sports research through cooperation between the sports healthcare station Helsingin Urheilulkriasema and universities, says Simo Tarvonen, CEO of Urhea-halli Oy.The Hoas student-housing apartment building at the campus will be the first student housing complex meant for athletes in Helsinki. The housing solutions seek to support residents everyday life and communal living. The housing complex was designed with attention to the age of residents and the fact that many residents come from other parts of Finland. There are considerably more shared spaces than in regular Hoas student housing buildings. Its highly challenging to combine competitive sports and studies. A close proximity of housing to training and learning facilities creates the best conditions for efficient use of time, says Hoas CEO Matti
Tarhoin. He continues, Hoas wants to create conditions and a better foundation for competitive sports in Finland together with the Sports Academy and the City of Helsinki.The Mkelnrinne Upper Secondary School building will be renovated and expanded to produce modern and adaptable learning facilities. The building will provide students with a motivating and enjoyable learning environment. Building technologies will also be upgraded.The school will expand from the current 850 students to 1,000 students. In addition to the Mkelnrinne Upper Secondary School, the building also accommodates a night upper secondary school and a unit of Perho Culinary, Tourism and Business College.The Mkelnrinne school building is a centre of recreational activities, which is in active use from morning to night. The expansion was designed with regard to recreational users as well.Construction work started in May 2019 with alterations to connections between buildings in the maintenance yard and continued in June with the demolishing of the school buildings kitchen wing. The housing apartment building will be started in the summer and the sports hall in September. The building complex is scheduled for completion in spring 2021.The sports hall is implemented by Urhea-halli Oy, the apartment building by the Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region (Hoas)and the renovation and expansion of the school building by the City of Helsinki.Mkelnrinne students also train at the Mkelnrinne Swimming Centre. A proposal for an alteration to the detailed plan enabling an expansion of the Swimming Centre will be next considered by the Helsinki City Board.Renderings above: (Top) the campus seen from Mkelnkatu

The curious urban festival Pointti, organised jointly by Yle and the City of Helsinki, attracted interested visitors to Helsinkis Kansalaistori Square on 13 August. The festival guests got to follow several Yle live broadcasts, make weather forecasts, re-commentate classic sports moments and come up with ideas for a better Helsinki.According to the organisers, an estimated 25,000 people visited the event during the three days. The Helsinki Central Library Oodis visitor counter, located in the Pointti event area, registered more than 50,000 visitors during the event. Pointti is a great addition to the event offerings of summery Helsinki. It attracted a vast number of visitors to the Kansalaistori Square, which is becoming a new kind of event centre in the City. Pointti inspired people of all ages to make and try different kinds of interesting things, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The City of Helsinki participated in Pointti through a comprehensive programme. At the Kansalaistori Square, it was possible to try out diverse activities, from baby circus to night basketball. A Helsinki summer classic, playground meals, was also available for testing. At the Kotoklubi, everyday Finnish language was learned through play, activities and singing.The Pointti festival also celebrated the opening of the Sananvapauden aukio (Freedom of Speech Square). And the Helsinki Biennial pre-party when the marine ecological art workshop examined Baltic Sea water and algae with microscopes and painted sea organisms. The international contemporary art event Helsinki Biennial conquers Vallisaari for the first time in the summer of 2020.The urban festivals programme included, e.g., live broadcasts of A-Studio and Villi Kortti, yoga sessions and ornament workshop according to Strmss instructions. Yle Radio 1, Yle Radio Suomi, Yle Puhe and Yle Vega sent live broadcasts from the Oodi lobby during all three days. Pikku Kakkonens Adventure machine and Buu-klubben entertained the children. There is clear a demand for a new festival with interesting content. The festival spread out in the Helsinki city centre to the Kansalaistori Square, the Central Library Oodi and the Makasiinipuisto Park.During the three days, Pointtis live broadcast was started 62,700 times on Yle Areena. It was possible to watch Pointti's programme during the entire festival on Yle Areena. The festival programme and moods have been compiled on yle.fi/pointti and on social media under the tags #pointti2019 and #punkten2019.

Road transport is the main source of air pollutants and environmental noise in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Air pollutants and noise weaken living comfort and the quality of the living environment, and they cause health hazards.
  A wider use of non-studded winter tyres and road user charges for vehicles would significantly improve air quality and noise conditions in the city. Promotion of both measures is recorded in the City of Helsinki air quality plan and noise abatement action plan.Helsinki air quality weakened slightly in 2018 from the previous year. Some of the busy city-centre street canyons continued to exceed the annual nitrogen-oxide limit value due to vehicle exhaust emissions. However, average nitrogen oxide concentrations have been reduced, and the total length of street sections in which the annual limit value is exceeded has shortened.According to measurements conducted by Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY), concentrations of particulate matter in air have been reduced in Helsinki in recent years, which shows that the long-term development of street dust prevention and measures to reduce street dust have been effective. The EU limit value has not been exceeded at the HSY air quality monitoring stations since 2006. However, dust levels in the spring of 2018 exceeded the previous years levels due to weather conditions.There is still danger that limit values of particles in air can be exceeded in inner-city street canyons and on busy roads, if we dont focus intensely on street dust prevention each year, points out Pivi
Kippo-Edlund, Director of Environmental Protection at City of Helsinki.Street dust reaches high levels on many days every spring, as road and street surfaces dry and the flow of traffic releases materials accumulated on surfaces over winter months into air. Studies show that about half of street dust consists of material detached from asphalt surfaces by studded winter tyres. A wider use of non-studded winter tyres would both lower dust levels and reduce noise. The goal is to reduce the use of studded winter tyres to about one-third of all vehicles in the future.Each year some road and street sections are repaved with low-noise road surfaces. The use of such surfaces can significantly reduce the noise caused by road traffic at speeds that cause the most noise. Noise levels have been found to decrease by 24 decibels. Studded tyres cause more wear to low-noise road surfaces than non-studded tyres. As the surfaces wear, their noise abatement properties weaken. A wider use of non-studded winter tyres would significantly improve possibilities to use low-noise road surfaces.Road user charges for vehicles would reduce traffic volumes in the city, which would improve air quality and noise conditions. Charges would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by road transport. Road user charges for vehicles play important roles in the MAL 2019 land use, housing and transport plan and the Carbon-neutral Helsinki 2035 action plan. Introduction of charges would require legislative changes.Read more:Helsinki air quality plan 20172024Helsinki noise abatement action plan

Two shared spaces are now available for residents in the Kruunuvuorenranta district in eastern Helsinki.
One of the shared spaces is located on the attic level of a parking hall. The space comprises a gym, an events and meeting hall, and a leisure-activities area for crafts. The Borgstrminmki shared space is located in the same building and shared with a day care centre. The space is used by the day care centre in the daytime, and it is available for residents in the evening and on weekends. The space has a larger hall suitable for sports and meetings and smaller areas usable, for example, for remote work. Both spaces have a kitchen. We planned the uses of shared spaces together with residents in early 2016. There will be more shared spaces. The Haakonlahti area will have waterfront saunas for use by residents. We have plans for a shared space especially for events in the Kruunuvuori area, placed right at the waters edge and with particularly fine views. The planning has not started yet on either of these new shared spaces, says Project Manager Pirjo Sirnof the City of Helsinki.The shared spaces can be booked by residents of Kruunuvuorenranta through the local Kruunuverkko network. Kruunuvuorenranta contractors pay the City for the shared spaces at the beginning of each building construction project. As shared spaces separate from residential buildings are built in the area, single housing companies can make fewer such spaces.Read more:Helsinki New Horizons:

An electric garbage truck will be tested in the Helsinki inner city next year, starting in the autumn of 2020 according to a preliminary plan. The goal of the experiment is to have waste containers emptied with as little noise as possible and to reduce local emissions caused by waste collection such as exhaust gases and fine particles.
  The project will explore how much a fully electric garbage truck can reduce the noise caused by waste collection and how well such a truck is suited for waste collection in northern weather conditions.The use of electric vehicles does not cause immediate emissions, so they help to improve air quality. This is of high importance in the narrow streets of the inner city, where traffic-generated particulate matter has a particularly powerful impact on air quality.Read more:Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority HSY

A robot bus shuttles between the Redi shopping centre and the Isoisnsilta bridge in Kalasatama during the 2019 summer season. The bus, in service on line 26R, and its timetable are included in the Journey Planner of Helsinki Region Transport (HSL). The six-month robot bus experiment, under the several-year Helsinki RobobusLine project, stretches from May to November.The robot bus  an electric minibus  operates and carries passengers in regular traffic. Rides are free of charge to passengers during the experimental phase. The robot bus is operated by Rolan Oy, and the project is managed by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.The robot-bus shuttle in Kalasatama is in service on weekdays from 9:00 to 14:55, making three rounds in an hour. The three stops on the route are Redi, Polariksenkatu and Isoisnsilta. The minibus can take 8 passengers on board at a time. Some departures may, however, be cancelled. All disruptions and cancelled departures are announced in the Journey Planner.Robot buses are developed as a solution for the last-mile service, that is, taking riders from trunk line stops and public transport stations to stops near their homes and offices. On the Kalasatama robot bus line, this principle is put into practice for the first time in a highly urban testing environment. The experiment is also used to survey passengers on their user experience to explore the usability of robot buses.Robot bus experiments support Helsinkis goal to render the city carbon neutral by 2035 by providing customers with carbon-free mobility alternatives.Read more:Line

The third part leads the audience to meditate with music by Purcell and Dowland. The fourth part focuses on music by Bach, and the last part features a Baroque music ensemble from Mallorca.The concerts offer urban people tranquility, beauty, joy and inspiration amidst their everyday lives, says FiBO Executive Manager Laura
Kajander.
The wastewater treatment plants of Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY) in Viikinmki and Suomenoja achieved excellent results in 2018. The plants removed 97 percent of the phosphorous in wastewater. The Viikinmki plant removed 91 percent and the Suomenoja plant 76 percent of the nitrogen in wastewater.The combined nutrient loading of the wastewater treatment plants to the Baltic Sea was 1,048 tonnes of nitrogen and 23 tonnes of phosphorous in 2018. Nitrogen loading to the sea was reduced by 6.4 percent from the previous year. Phosphorous loading was reduced from 31 tonnes to 23 tonnes, which is the all-time record.Both plants conduct their treated wastewater into the Baltic Sea. Thus continuous improvement in operations is tangible work to protect the Baltic Sea, seeking to minimize the loading caused by people and industry. The year 2018 set a milestone at the Viikinmki wastewater treatment plant, as the plant reached the record rate of 97 percent in electricity self-sufficiency. The plants 2018 electricity generation rate was the highest in the plant history, and the plant was fully energy self-sufficient from May onwards, says Division Director Mari Heinonen at HSY.The increase in the plants energy self-sufficiency rate is a result of long-term efforts. Activities have been carried out and investments made systematically both to save energy and to generate energy in increasingly efficient ways. Read more:Wastewater treatment at HSY
The Bike Centre serves customers on the Baana bikeway at the Kansalaistori square throughout the summer season until the end of September. The centre reopened at its new location in late May, having served earlier in Kamppi and Herttoniemi.We wanted to move the services of the Bike Centre to a more prominent location and closer to cyclists. The new location and the new facilities were commented on positively by customers and passers-by immediately during the first week of operation. Baana was used by close to one million cyclists in 2018, so we expect a high number of visitors at our new Bike Centre, says Eeropekka
Lehtinen, a planner at Helsinki City Transport (HKL).The Bike Centre provides customers with opportunities for independent bicycle maintenance, with a mechanic on hand for advice and guidance.Bicycles can also be left at the centre for express bike repair by professionals for a fee. The centre provides information on the City Bikes bike-share programme and hands-on guidance on the use of City Bikes. The centre has a pumping station and the most essential tools, from chain whips to spoke keys. The staff are also available to answer questions about routes and the rules of the road.The Bike Centre started its 2019 season at full speed. Arto Mkinen, in charge of the centres bicycle maintenance operations, confirms: We were busy as early as the first week.
We have been surprised to see how old some of the bikes are that people ride. If you ride a very old bike, you should be prepared not to find spare parts very easily. The most common problem of cyclists is soft tires, and cyclists are sometimes surprised to find out how high the proper tire pressure is, Mkinen comments.The Bike Centre operations will be developed further. The goal is to include a bicycle wash and an electric bicycle charging station in the operations at Kansalaistori.
  The Bike Centre serves from Monday to Friday, 917, until the end of September. The earlier service locations at Narinkkatori in Kamppi and in Herttoniemi are no longer in operation.The Bike Centre is part of the City of Helsinki cycling promotion programme. The centres operations are managed by Helsinki City Transport HKL. The operations are run by Velo & Oxygen during the 2019 season.

Having completed its Sustainable Development Report in June, Helsinki handed it over to the UN at the follow-up conference on 18 July, as the first European city. Mayor Jan Vapaavuori spoke to the UN on the occasion.The High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  HLPF was held in New York on 919 July 2019. The UNs most important conference on sustainable development, the HLPF, assesses global progress towards the goals stated in the Agenda 2030 action programme for sustainable development. Kicked off in 2015, the Agenda 2030 action programme aims at eradication of extreme poverty and at sustainable development taking environment, economy and people equally into account. In September 2018, Helsinki voluntarily committed itself to reporting to the UN about its own implementation of the sustainable development goals, as the second city in the world, second only to New York. The report From Agenda to Action  The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019 was completed in June 2019. The findings of the report show that the goals in Helsinkis latest City Strategy match the UN sustainable development goals very well. Furthermore, Helsinki has already carried out or is in the process of carrying out many measures that promote the UN goals. The findings of the report will also be used to support the planning of the citys actions in future.Mayor Vapaavuori made his address at a session around the theme of developing the role of the High Level Political Forum so as to make it an even more efficient monitor of Agenda 2030 implementation when the first four-year cycle ends. In addition, Mayor Vapaavuori spoke at four related events, one of which is organised by the City of Helsinki together with the City of New York and the Permanent Mission of Finland to the UN. Helsinki and New York have been cooperating closely throughout the process, and they encourage other cities to engage into voluntary implementation reporting.The influence of cities in the world is constantly growing, owing to factors such as urbanisation and the urban nature of global challenges. Cities are increasingly joining ranks with states to solve global problems. The most important, concrete work with Agenda 2030 is done at local level - near people. Helsinki actively cooperates with other cities to ensure that the role of cities as influencers is acknowledged in key international forums and networks. In future, an important forum for cooperation between states and cities could be the implementation of the UN goals for sustainable development, Mayor Vapaavuori concludes.Themes emphasised by Finland in the forum included education, competence and future-skills, and their links to sustainable development. The delegation, headed by Minister of Education Li Andersson, included representatives of the City of Helsinki, several ministries, the local Agenda 2030 youth organisation as well as civic organisations and business. During the forum, Finland hosted two related events and organises, in its fresh capacity of President of the Council of the European Union, and together with the EU, the first event within the UN framework that presents the EUs work on the Agenda 2030.Jan Vapaavuori: the 2019 HLPF summit (pdf)Helsinki and the sustainable development goalsFrom Agenda to Action  The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019

Helsinki celebrated the opening of Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union with a relaxed park festival at Tlnlahti on Monday, 8 July. The all-day event welcomed thousands of visitors from Finland and abroad. All happenings and components of the festival echoed sustainability, which is an important theme for Finland during the presidency.Sustainability was reflected by the programme and sites, including a Youth Eco-caf, a hobbyhorse workshop with hobbyhorse materials provided by Helsinki Metropolitan Area Reuse Centre (Pkaupunkiseudun kierrtyskeskus), and biodegradable face glitter paints at the EU tent.The programme was received with enthusiasm, and the atmosphere was joyous. Some workshops were so popular that the organizers ran out of materials. We had to fetch more materials for the hobbyhorse workshop in the middle of the day. Many old woolen socks and floorball sticks got new lives, commented the producers of the park festivalHanna Iiskola and Hanna-Mari Ukkonen.The strongest messages about sustainability were delivered through the artwork Plastic Mama. The 30-metre-wide artwork created from recycled plastics was artist Kaisa Salmis statement about the state of the Earth. The artist addressed the audience from the top of the artwork for 10 hours.The Finnish Presidency opening festival also marked the launch of a Tlnlahti sports project, which challenges everybody to move around the Earth for the good of the Baltic Sea. The sports project extends through the Finnish Presidency period. Helsinki invites every resident, visitor and meeting guest to tour the Tlnlahti area, accumulating kilometres on a joint tour around the Earth. If and when we log enough kilometres to circle the Earth, about 40,000 kilometres, the City of Helsinki will donate the funds originally earmarked for gifts to meeting participants, a total of 50,000 euros, to Baltic Sea protection, affirmed Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori in his opening speech. The Tlnlahti area was put to use as a festival site to an unprecedented extent. The festival site stretched from the Kansalaistori square to the shores of the Tl bay. The area served the purpose well, and the many event booths and locations including daytime dance grounds and childrens venues had plenty of space in the park. For the first time, the international youth football tournament Helsinki Cup brought its games to the heart of the city. Prime Minister Antti Rinne and Mayor Vapaavuori kicked off Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union together with Helsinki Cup players. The kickoff was taken by Mayor Vapaavuori, to be caught by goalkeeper Frank Ahlgren.The festival day ended with the official opening of Helsinki Cup with thousands of children and young people defying rain.The Finnish Presidency opening festival was organized by the City of Helsinki in cooperation with the Finnish Prime Ministers Office, Europe Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, the offices of the European Parliament and Commission in Finland, and Helsinki Cup.The best moments of the park festival can be relived on the City of Helsinki social media channels.

They can join a traditional park workout and a 1920s-style workout, both to live music. The artists and ensembles featured on the main stage include Sandra Lngbacka and Stadin juhlaorkesteri.An urban space for
diverse public eventsThe artwork Massa in Makasiinipuisto serves as a recreational space, as a playground and even as a skateboarding site. The artwork created by artist Akseli Leinonenfrom red bricks commemorates the red-brick railway warehouses that occupied the site until they were destroyed in a fire in 2006. A site has been reserved in the park for a pavilion to be possibly built later.The area of the Makasiinipuisto park and the Kansalaistori square is an urban public space for multiple uses. The area is the starting point of the Helsinki Central Park, and it can be used for diverse public events. The area has been built since spring 2018. The construction, which at first included water mains work, interfered with movement in the area, but movement is now easy after the completion of construction.

Helsinki has been determinedly testing robot buses since 2016. The pilots have developed and expanded year by year. This year, you can get on a self-driving bus in living lab district Kalasatama and on a record-long 2.5 km route in the most eastern district Vuosaari. Congested streets full of passenger cars are a challenge for growing cities around the world. Also Helsinki is looking for means to decrease traffic congestion as well as emissions and other climate impacts caused by motor vehicles. A key means to influence this is investment in public transportation, but its proportion of traffic has remained almost the same in recent years. However, self-driving robot buses could increase the popularity and efficiency of public transportation in the future. This is why Helsinki has been testing them for several years. The aim is to use the pilots to learn as much as possible about robot buses even in the early stages of technological development, such as how residents receive them, how they function as a part of public transportation and what they can offer to the mobility of citizens, says Jari Honkonen, Project manager at the City of Helsinkis innovation company Forum Virium Helsinki. Robot buses can change public transportation significantlyHelsinki is committed to become carbon neutral by 2035 and, in line with this, recognises that problems associated to traffic and transport need to be tackled. Therefore, the city has laid down in its official strategy to act as a testbed and to promote new mobility technologies - of which automated demand-driven shuttle buses are a notable example. By offering residents an emission-free transportation option, robot buses support Helsinkis goals of carbon neutrality. If the robot bus technology develops as expected, they can develop public transportation in a more cost-efficient direction and enhance service levels by expanding its coverage to areas where the lines do not currently reach, making departures more frequent and public transportation more reachable, Jari Honkonen says.There is still much to be tested around self-driving buses, so the pilots will continue for the years to come, ultimately contributing to making Helsinki the most functional smart city of the world.Read more:Forum Virium
The public park party in the Tlnlahti Park and on the Kansalaistori Square mark the opening of Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 8 July. The summer days programme is abundant and its main theme is sustainability. The opening event is also the kick-off for the Tlnlahti Bay activity event, where the participants walk, jog or run together around the world in 180 days for the Baltic Sea. The participants wake up to the festive summer day in the Tlnlahti Park at nine o'clock with morning workout backed by live music. The pace slowly increases towards the official opening of the summer festival at 1 pm, when Prime Minister Antti Rinne and Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori inaugurate the party together with the children of Helsinki Cup. The programme continues through the day. The day will hold a rocknroll workout with the Finnish band Waltari, brushing up dance moves at traditional partner dances, a sweat-inducing beach sauna or enjoyment at a park picnic. There will also be a number of summer activities for the children: A gig by children's band Pikku Papun Orkesteri, a hobby horse track and different kinds of workshops. The evening culminates in the opening of the Helsinki Cup, when thousands of junior footballers from 21 countries gather to take the match oath. Games played by the youngest juniors can be watched next to the Finlandia Hall from the early morning.Sustainability the theme at the Kansalaistori SquareAmong the themes of the presidency, Finland has chosen to highlight climate change as an important part of the opening celebrations. Artist Kaisa Salmis artwork called Plastic Mama will be mounted on the Kansalaistori Square. Made of recycled plastic by the artist and thousands of volunteers, Plastic Mama is a baroque dress that will soar to a height of ten metres. Finlands and the EU organs EU playing field tent brings together the citizens and the decision-makers to discuss Finlands Presidency and the European Union. Some more laid-back activities for visitors of all ages will also be on offer at the tent: play table football or get your face painted in biodegradable glitter colours.The City of Helsinki arranges the opening ceremony of Finlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union in cooperation with the Prime Minister's Office, the Europe Information at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, the EU Parliaments and the European Commissions representation in Finland as well as the Helsinki Cup.Read more:Signals from Helsinki - Sustainable Solutions in HelsinkiLaunch of the Tlnlahti Bay activity event The summer day is also the start of the six-month Tlnlahti Bay activity campaign. The goal is to go around the Tlnlahti Bay by walking, running or jogging and accrue kilometres worth a journey around the world to the joint odometer. The Tlnlahti round is 2.2 kilometres and the earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 kilometres, or 18,182 times the circumference of the Tlnlahti Bay. If the Tlnlahti walkers, joggers and runners manage to accrue a sufficient amount of kilometres in six months, then Helsinki will make a 50,000 donation to the protection of the Baltic Sea. Thus, like the Government, the City of Helsinki does not hand out gifts to the meeting guests of Finlands presidency and the aim is rather to direct Helsinkis immaterial gift to the protection of the Baltic Sea from plastic waste.The journey can be followed in real time at maailmanymprysmatka.fi.Programme:Main stage9.009.50 Waltari plays puistojumppa - workout in the park, live music 13.0013.30 Event opening14.3015.00 Performance by Sandra Lngbacka15.4516.15 Performance by the Stadi Party Band17.0017.50 Waltari plays puistojumppa - workout in the park, live music20.0021.00 Helsinki Cup openingChildrens stage10.0010.45 Maapallo music nursery14.0014.10 Ruffle Army giant soap bubble show15.0015.45 Performance by the Pikku Papu Band16.3017.00 Playground Loru makes you sing and playVilla Hakasalmi11.0017.00 Carefree Capital  an exhibition11.3012.30 1920s workout15.0016.00 1920s workoutKansalaistori Square10.0020.00 Plastic Mama piece of environmental art10.0020.00 Escape Room with waste theme10.3011.00 Playground Loru makes you sing and play11.0020.00 The EU as a playing field14.0014.45 The Musiikkitalo  Helsinki Music Centre summer concertInformation corner13.0019.30 Event information corner13.3019.00 Starting point of My2050 environmental game13.3019.00 Starting point of Mobile Sonic WalkWorkshops13.3019.00 Jylh  multi art plant tunnel complex13.3019.00 Art workshops, nonstop13.3018.30 Hobbyhorse workshop and riding course, nonstop14.0015.00 Bath whisk workshop17.0018.00 Bath whisk workshopSummer activities9.0021.00 Sauna by Tl Bay Beach9.0019.00 Caf Veranda, picnic baskets on sale9.0019.00 City boats, subject to a fee9.0019.00 Reading, games, and walking around Tl Bay10.0017.00 Helsinki Cup junior football tournament13.3017.00 Garden games14.0016.00 Afternoon dance with a live band and under the guidance of a dance teacher17.0019.00 Afternoon dance with a live band and under the guidance of a dance teacherProgramme and map (pdf)The Summer Day Festival webpages
Helsinki ranks 10th best in the world as a city for cyclists in the new edition of the Copenhagenize Index. The ranking is Helsinkis best ever in this index, which is produced by the
  Copenhagenize Design Co. planning and design agency once in every two years. Helsinki ranked 18th in the 2017 index.Copenhagenizes assessment acknowledges Helsinkis ambitious goals for cycling, plans for an extensive cycling route network and the construction of new routes.Reetta Keisanen, Cycling Coordinator at City of Helsinki, is delighted with the award.The construction of state-of-the-art cycling routes in Helsinki is a result of work carried out over several years. Its magnificent that our work wins an international award. It tells us that were on the right course, and well continue our efforts so well climb on the index step by step, Keisanen says.Helsinki also received recommendations for further development. Despite the progress, the implementation of the Helsinki cycling route network and its funding should be accelerated. Other drawbacks in Helsinki according to the assessment include the closure of the bike-share system for the winter season and lack of government inputs in the funding of cycling routes.Next well focus on the said drawbacks to accelerate the implementation of the cycling route network and to improve the quality of the network, Keisanen continues.Other awarded cities set good examples for Helsinki, such as Oslo, which resembles Helsinki in terms of cycling conditions. Oslo rose by several ranks in the index. The city has hired 20 persons to promote cycling.In addition, top-ranking Copenhagen now serves as a model for Helsinki, as the city is a mentor for Helsinki in the EU-funded HANDSHAKE project. Cities collaborate in this project to develop cycling solutions.Helsinki  as other cities worldwide  develop cycling as a means to create a safer, more enjoyable and more functional city. The more people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport rather than drive, increasing numbers of people can move smoothly in the city.Helsinki was presented the award at the annual Velo-City cycling conference. The award was received by Reetta Keisanen and key persons who have developed cycling solutions in Helsinki, including representatives of the City of Helsinki Urban Environment Division, Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), Helsinki City Transport (HKL), consultancies and the cycling network Pyrilykuntien verkosto.Read more:Copenhagenize index 2019
A year ago, Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori launched the idea of a brainstorming platform for all Helsinkians, which would be carried out through the Most Functional City in the World website.The Most Functional City in the World website was open during the beginning of the year and more than 400 ideas were submitted. A working group of city experts went through the proposals and made a pre-selection The experiment was pleasant and there was an abundance of ideas. In the service, we were especially looking for neat improvements to everyday life and there were plenty of such ideas. We have good feedback channels for reporting different kinds of flaws, but coming up with new ideas is worth encouraging as well, says Vapaavuori. In June, it was two years since Jan Vapaavuori started as Mayor of Helsinki.  Helsinki is a positively active city, whose residents like to engage in the brainstorming of new events and participate in the development of the City. This is a great resource. Helsinki becomes more enjoyable and the worlds most functional city only together with the citizens, says Vapaavuori.A more
service-minded and active Helsinki wanted by manyMany good ideas were concerned with a more service-minded Helsinki. Over the years, the services have become bloated with bulky features that waste the time of customers and city employees alike.The
ordering of the Laakso hospital service voucher could be made into an
e-service. The customer receives a letter in the mail when the referral has
arrived. If the customer wants a service voucher, he or she must call the
number mentioned in the letter on Tuesday or Thursday 9am-11am or 12noon-2pm
and ask for the creation of an electronic service voucher. The electronic
service voucher with a customer number is sent to the customer in the mail on
paper, whereupon the customer can announce the customer number to the service
provider in order to be able to book an appointment. The entire process could
be taken care of electronically in a minute." There were a lot of other thoughts on making services electronic and on embracing the digital age as well. The Citys new digitalisation programme with its executive groups is solving these challenges. Other popular ideas were the ones aimed at making the urban space more pleasant and active. Other wishes included livelier market squares, more litter bins in the entire City and higher park benches. The signage and the removal of high setts and especially the winter maintenance of pedestrian routes gained a lot of support. Ideas, which were outside the City's powers or deemed too extensive or inconsistent with valid decisions or the City Strategy, were discarded at the beginning of the evaluation process. The next stage with more detailed considerations comprises 41 ideas, some of which are concerned with the same topic. The viable ideas will be introduced in the Citys different services. A list of the ideas is here.More

The outpatient clinic for the intellectually disabled and oral health care services at Rinnekoti in Espoo were discontinued on 1 July 2019. In the future, residents will get the same services from their own municipality.The Rinnekoti outpatient clinic for the intellectually disabled has been in charge of approximately 150 residents of Helsinki living either in or outside Helsinki. The services related to intellectual disabilities offered to these people will now be transferred to the Helsinki outpatient clinic for the intellectually disabled. Oral health care services as well as services concerning aids for medicinal rehabilitation will be transferred to the municipality that the patient has chosen as their basic health care service provider.Customers of long-term institutional treatment and assessment and rehabilitation periods at Rinnekoti may still see a doctor, a psychologist, an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist as well as a communication instructor at Rinnekoti.Services for the intellectually disabled will not be reduced or weakened in Helsinki. Instead, they will be organised by the City.In the future, please contact the outpatient clinic for the intellectually disabled approximately two months in advance of the desired visit for a needs assessment and in order to schedule the visit.The contact information for the Helsinki outpatient clinic for the intellectually disabled can be found at www.hel.fi/vammaiset/en.For further information on Rinnekoti (in Finnish), please visit www.rinnekoti.fi.
The experiment to include Helsinki Youth Council representatives at division committee meetings ended in late May 2019. As the experiment was positively received, Youth Council representatives will continue to attend committee meetings on a regular basis.
As in the experiment, which ran through the spring season 2019, Youth Council representatives will have a right to attend and to speak at committee meetings from here on. The experiment achieved the objectives set for the experiment, which were to increase youth participation and understanding of municipal decision-making processes. According to the views of elected officials, young people and office holders, Youth Council representatives presented new viewpoints to the work of committees, as well as well argued and valid comments.
  The Helsinki City Board has approved a procedure according to which the Youth Council elects three representatives from among Council members for each division committee. One representative at a time should attend a committee meeting, and attendance should rotate among the representatives as evenly as possibly. Committee members serve as patrons to Youth Council representatives, supporting the committee work of the representatives.Successful
experiment extending over spring season 2019
 The Helsinki City Executive Group decided in the autumn of 2018 to initiate an experiment lasting for the spring season 2019 to give representatives of the Helsinki Youth Council a right to attend and to speak at the meetings of the committees of the City of Helsinki divisions. The experiment started at the beginning of February, and Youth Council representatives attended the meetings of all four committees during the spring season. The experiment sought to improve the hearing and engagement of young people as well as to strengthen the Youth Councils opportunities for participation and exerting influence. The right to attend and to speak at committee meetings did not include a right to make or support proposals and to vote.Youth Council representatives addressed committees about 50 times during the spring season in matters concerning young people. Their statements dealt with the prevention of young peoples social exclusion and loneliness, support for leisure activities of children and youth, and public spaces.The results of the experiment were evaluated at a meeting of elected officials and young people on 11 June. Youth Council representatives in the experiment were acknowledged for their preparedness for committee meetings, their familiarity with meeting agendas and to-the-point statements. Youth Council representatives expressed their gratitude for the trust bestowed in them and a wish that youth representation at committee meetings should be continued as a regular activity.The results of the experiment were evaluated with an online survey taken by 45 persons. 90 percent of young people considered the experiment to be highly successful. 82 percent of elected officials and 95 percent of City representatives considered the experiment to be either highly successful or fairly successful.No survey respondent considered the outcome of the Youth Council attendance at committee meetings to be fairly poor or very poor. Areas for improvement suggested included familiarization of young people and various representation models. Furthermore, it was suggested that young people and the Youth Council could impact decisions more efficiently if they were heard earlier in the decision-making process, that is, at the decision-preparation stage.Pictured above are the Helsinki Youth Council representatives who attended division committee meetings: (from left) Elo Umukoro, Jim Koskinen, Tilda Lassila, Sigrid Autio, Vivian Ljungqvist, Alma Rantalaiho and Dan Cederlf.

The architecture students of University of Westminster and Aalto University in Finland co-operate in building a wooden tea pavilion in front of the Design Museum. The tea pavilion opens on 3rd July and stays open until the end of the Helsinki Design Week on 15th September. During this time anyone can come to the pavilion to drink tea and eat snacks.With the tea pavilion project, the Finnish Institute in London wants to support the principles of sustainable development and at the same time, it creates international networks.The tea pavilion celebrates the anniversary of diplomatic relationship between Finland and Great Britain. In May it was a hundred years since Britain acknowledged the independence of Finland. The Finnish architect Sami Rintala, who specializes in wood construction, guides the students work. In practice the pavilion is produced in two countries: the bigger parts are made in Wood Studio at Aalto University and the smaller and lighter parts in London, from where they then travel with the students to Helsinki. Finally, the students meet at the building plot and construct the pavilion. How does the end result then look like in real size? How does it feel to step inside for the first time? How does English tea taste like in a park in Helsinki? Soon we will find out, says Rintala.Tea and snacks can be bought from the cafeteria at the Design Museum during its opening hours and brought to the site. Additionally, it is possible to bring own snacks to the pavilion around the clock.
Finlands Presidency of the Council of the EU, which starts today, will bring Helsinki a lot of international visibility. The delegates that visit our city can experience the sustainable everyday solutions of Helsinki. Moreover, they are invited to enjoy the activities in the Tl bay area.- Helsinki is a forerunner in Europe when it comes to sustainable urban development, and during the Finnish Presidency we want to highlight solutions that are not only environmentally friendly and energy efficient, but are also built on the well-being, equality and good routines of the citizens, emphasises Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.- Over the upcoming six months, the Most Functional City in the World will offer the EU meetings and their delegates a safe, smooth and functional setting as well as attractive urban culture, next-door nature and Finnish experiences. 
Tl bay
main stage for the meeting delegates

All EU Presidency meetings to be held in Finland have been centralised in Helsinki, permitting sustainable meeting arrangements. Some 20,000 meeting delegates and 1,000 representatives of foreign media are expected to visit the Finnish capital.
As most of the meetings are held at the Finlandia Hall, the visitors spend most of their time in the Tl bay area. Together with other players, Helsinki has therefore decided to offer an interesting set of experiences in the area,

  where urban pulse and peaceful nature meet.The Presidency will be opened with a park party for everyone, the Summer Day at Tl Bay, on 8 July. This event covers everything from rocknroll workout with the Finnish band Waltari and traditional partner dances to programmes within the environment theme, such as an escape room focused on waste and the giant Plastic Mama artwork.For children there are many summery activities, performances and workshops during the day. The evening culminates in the opening of the youth football tournament Helsinki Cup. Games played by the youngest juniors can be watched next to the Finlandia Hall from the early morning.From July to late in the autumn, there will be a Helsinki container on the shore of Tl bay, where you can get information about the area. Books, outdoor exercise kits and outdoor games can be borrowed from the container.A new pedestrian map of the Tl bay area has been published for the Presidency. A mobile sonic walk at Tl bay, produced in cooperation with the Sibelius Academy, lets you dive into the historical strata of the area. Sustainable
development in everyday lifeHelsinki is a forerunner among the European cities for instance when it comes to measuring the UNs sustainable development goals.

Helsinki has joined an extensive digital innovation project launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies. The new initiative for European capital cities aims to accelerate digital innovation to improve critical services for residents.The New Digital Innovation Project for European Cities was launched by Michael
R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies and former mayor of New York City, in London on 25 June 2019.All 28 European capital cities have been invited to join the project. Through project support, grants, and professional development programming for Chief Digital Officers and other key leaders, Bloomberg Philanthropies aims to help European cities to consolidate digital leadership and to share lessons learned with cities across the rest of the world.
A critical part of the Helsinki City Strategy is our commitment to making better sense of global change. Helsinki aims to be the city in the world that makes the best use of digitalization. Our collaboration with Michael R. Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies enables Helsinki to succeed in these critical issues and to work with other cities in concrete ways, says Helsinki Mayor Jan
Vapaavuori.Cities participating in the initiative will benefit from a range of supports to advance local efforts. Chief Innovation, Digital, Data, and Information Officers who are driving these efforts will receive leadership support focused on building strong teams and managing transformational change. Cities will be eligible for innovation grants and project support, delivered by world-class partners to help transform critical public services. In addition, cities will benefit from best practice sharing and peer-to-peer networking.The City of Helsinki has an ambitious digitalization strategy aimed at creating better digital services for citizens. A requirement for the creation of new proactive and customized services is ethical use of data and AI, says Mikko Rusama, Chief Digital Officer at City of Helsinki.We look forward to deepening cooperation with Bloomberg Philanthropies and with leading smart cities such as London. Cities should work together to solve shared challenges, Rusama continues.At the time of the announcement by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mayor Vapaavuori participated in a two-day meeting in London for the mayors of EU capital cities. He spoke at the meeting on EUs urban agenda and challenges in safety and security faced by cities  that is, some of the main themes of the mayoral meeting. In a joint statement, the mayors committed themselves to closer collaboration to counteract extreme ideologies and polarization and to fight climate change. Read more:About

A record number of congresses chose Helsinki as their host city in 2018. According to the annual congress city statistics published by the Union of International Associations (UIA) this week, Helsinki is the most popular Nordic city for organising congresses.Helsinki improved its position in the overall rankings to 14th, leaving behind it such cities as Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo. Last year, Helsinki hosted a total of 329 international association meetings. Work-related travel accounted for around a half of all visits to Helsinki, and a total of 4.17 million overnight stays were registered in Helsinki in 2018.Helsinki is known as a reliable and functional congress city. Helsinkis advantages include its efficient services and cooperation with local event organisers. This is the result of close collaboration and a fine achievement for the entire industry. Helsinki is the worlds most functional city, also for congress organisers, comments Leena Lassila, Director, Global Sales, at Helsinki Marketing.Helsinki expects another busy year in 2019. Already three major international events have been organised in Helsinki at the start of the summer: the 29th Annual Meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC Europe  2000 delegates), the World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF  1500 delegates) and the European Conference of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS & Health 2.0  3000 delegates). The peak season this year, however, is expected in the autumn. For example, Europe's largest international higher education conference, the 31st Annual EAIE Conference and Exhibition, will be held in Helsinki in September and is expected to attract an estimated 6000 delegates.Congress activities in line with sustainable developmentHelsinki is also a leader in the congress sector in terms of sustainable development. Each year, the Global Destination Sustainability (GDS) Index ranks congress destinations on the basis of their environmental deeds and social responsibility, as well as the commitment of service providers and the activities of convention bureaus  i.e. Helsinki Marketings Congress Bureau  from the perspective of sustainability. The purpose is to promote awareness of sustainable solutions among congress actors.Helsinki ranked 5th in the GDS Index in 2018 and 6th in 2017. Responsibility is of growing importance among event organisers. This year we are piloting a responsible congress organisation model that offers event organisers easy-to-use tools to organising even more responsible events, Lassila explains.Congresses are a significant source of income for Helsinkis tourism industryCongresses help enhance awareness and appeal for the host city. Helsinkis advantages include not only a reliable reputation, the high quality of services, excellent connections and safety, but also the high standard of research in many scientific fields. Helsinki aims to attract a growing number of international association meetings, business conferences and related events. Helsinkis position as a centre of leading expertise supports this aim.Attracting major events to the city requires long-term work, but the rewards in terms of income are significant. The average congress visitor generates up to five times more tourism income than the average tourist. Congress visitors also stay in Helsinki for more nights, and many choose Helsinki as a future holiday destination.Helsinkis appeal as a congress city is also growing due to increased accommodation capacity. The Helsinki metropolitan area currently has approximately 19,000 rooms, and at least 5000 more rooms are expected in the near future. Even though our accommodation capacity is quite a lot smaller than the other Nordic capitals, we are still the number one congress city in the Nordics, Lassila points out.

Six Finnish organisations have kicked off a project to standardise public organisations transparency and communications of the use of AI to citizens. The project, named Citizen Trust Through AI Transparency, will provide internationally adoptable guidelines on how to inform about public sector use of personal data and AI to the citizens.The project participants are City of Espoo, City of Helsinki, Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland), Finlands Ministry of Justice, The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra and Saidot (AI transparency software development company). They will together:Maintaining trust between citizens and administrationTransparency of citizen data usage and algorithmic decision-making is a widely recognised global challenge. AI systems and algorithmic decision-making are increasingly used in public administration to service citizens in their various life-events, however, people do not have access to sufficient information about what, by whom and how these decisions are being made. Hence, by offering standardised information and communication guidelines on personal data usage, AI systems and algorithmic decision-making, the project wishes to maintain trust between citizens and cities & governments.
The participant organisations expertise and interaction with citizens will be utilised to combine the regulatory, technological, ethical and citizen perspectives for a recommendation on shared practice. Real-life use cases and citizen feedback will be used to understand the future needs and current knowledge levels on the use of AI in the public sector. Citizen engagement is imperative for the project, hence people will be involved via interviews and workshops. We want to openly communicate to the citizens how and
for what purposes their information is being used, and what are the decisions
that impact their lives based on. This information must be easily accessible
and relevant information for the residents must be communicated in a clear and
understandable manner, says City of Espoos Data-Analytics Consultant, Tomas Lehtinen."In
Helsinki, we discuss widely the use of AI, and the ethics of it. In
collaboration with other cities, we work on the design of ethical principles
for AI. When making use of AI, its essential to maintain trust. Openness and
transparency help to build that trust, says Pasi Rautio, the Lead Development Coordinator of data, AI and robotization of City of Helsinki.A benchmark for other cities and governmentsThe overall objective of the citizen project is to agree on a shared approach so that the same model can be taken into use widely across public sector organisations. Informing citizens in a standardised way will also improve the understandability of the information for the citizens. Finland is one of the leaders in ethical AI development and is proud to share this knowledge internationally. This project is an excellent opportunity to set a benchmark and be an example for other European and North American cities and governments to adopt. The outcomes of the project will be licensed under Creative Commons. Project news can be followed on Twitter under the hashtag #CitizenTrustAI.
The City of Helsinki has issued decisions on noise announcements made on the summers outdoor music festivals, concerts and other events. Most outdoor concerts in Helsinki this summer will be held in the Suvilahti cultural centre area.Music festivals to be held in Suvilahti in June-August 2019 include Tuska Open Air, Weekend Festival and Flow Festival. A number of one-day concerts will also be held in the Suvilahti area.
The following list comprises the decisions made so far on noise announcements on summer events. Noise announcements on events include sound tests on days preceding the events, as well as the actual event days.All documents behind the below links are in Finnish.JuneJulyAugustMore decisions on noise announcements will be made in the near future. Noise announcements on the following outdoor events are in process:All decisions on noise announcements and the grounds for the decisions can be found on the City of Helsinki website at https://dev.hel.fi/paatokset/.The decisions were made on the basis of the end-of-event policy for outdoor concerts issued by the City of Helsinki Environment Centre (today Urban Environment Divisions Environment Services) in 2016 and updated in 2017. The policy is applied for the fourth consecutive year.
No noise announcement will be required in the summer of 2020, if sound amplification ends no later than 22:00. However, the requirement will remain to provide information on the event in accordance with Section 17 of the City of Helsinki environmental protection regulations.The City of Helsinki conducted a survey in 2015 on outdoor concerts among residents living in the vicinity of concert venues.

  Helsinkis population keeps on growing, and the city is in the midst of demographic and physical city-structural change. Our growing city needs new high-quality housing areas. In addition, it needs to safeguard the social wellbeing of residents and ensure that development in the city is in harmony with the citys climate targets.The latest issue of Helsinki Quarterly  appearing today  makes an overview of current demographic trends in Finland, trends that are increasingly bringing new residents into the major city regions, especially the Helsinki Region. In addition, the journal presents measures in Helsinki to curb climate change, as well as climate attitudes among residents and, also, an evaluation made by the city of how well the UN goals for sustainable development have been achieved in Helsinki.
A dense and safe urban structureMeeting ecological ambitions, among others, many of the new housing developments in Helsinki are dense and city-like, and pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure is a key factor. One of the articles of the fresh Helsinki Quarterly looks at influences behind the present planning ideals and at the history of construction in Inner Helsinki. From the angle of social sustainability, the safety of residents is an important element in the urban environment. The issue also presents a recurrent safety survey in Helsinki evaluating how safe residents feel in their home town and their own neighbourhood.Helsinki Quarterly is the annual English-language issue of the Kvartti journal published by the City of Helsinki. Kvartti appears three times a year in Finnish and Swedish presenting fresh research and statistics on Helsinki.

Financial activities, where knowledge plays a big part, are geographically very concentrated. The companies themselves benefit from it as well, because, according to the study, shorter distances further the networking that occurs through the employee mobility between companies. Other organisational forms of proximity, such as the educational background of the personnel at the companies, are also connected to it. This is according to a fresh study published by the Helsinki City Executive Office. In the Helsinki-Uusimaa Region, the functionality of the labour market and the networking of the companies can be furthered by creating land-use related prerequisites for geographic proximity. This can be achieved by developing especially the business clusters and well accessible areas in the region.Proximity furthers networks in smaller
clusters as well in the entire Helsinki-Uusimaa RegionAgglomerations benefit companies in many ways: shorter distances increase the employee mobility between the business establishments, as the transfers of employees from one organisation to another are more likely to occur between business establishments that are geographically closer to each other. With the employees, knowledge and networks are also transferred across the borders.According to the results of the study, companies in knowledge-intensive industries benefit from shorter distances in all areas of the Helsinki-Uusimaa region. This occurs in both dense business clusters and in less dense areas, where the business establishments are geographically further away from each other on average. This is relevant for the future growth outlook of the area, as the significance of knowledge in the production processes is constantly growing.The growth of the strongest business clusters into increasingly dense, diverse and functional business areas should thus be supported. It is essential to enable complementary construction and renovation of old constructions, to make sure that the supply of premises can adapt to the changing demand in attractive areas. When the operating conditions of companies in the Helsinki-Uusimaa region are developed, it is integral to make use of the opportunities presented by the rail traffic services and the well accessible station and stop surroundings.
The Helsinki City Executive Offices fresh study analyses how geographic proximity is linked to employee mobility between business establishments in knowledge-intensive industries in the Helsinki-Uusimaa region, and how the significance of the proximity varies between different types of areas in the region. This study has been compiled as part of the ROBUST project for the research and development of modes and administrative models for interregional interaction in Europe. The research material has been compiled by connecting geographic location data of business establishments in knowledge-intensive industries with data from Statistics Finlands registers concerning business establishments and their personnel.

A new solar power plant of Helsinki City Transport (HKL) generates an equal amount of electricity that would power more than 200 apartment building units for a year. The power plant enables HKL to reduce its carbon footprint.HKL commissioned its solar power plant on 18 June 2019. The plant is located at the Roihupelto Metro depot. It powers the depot and so reduces HKLs carbon footprint. All electricity consumed by HKL rail transport services is already carbon-free, being produced with Nordic wind and hydro power.In-house solar power generation is part of HKLs responsibility. We seek to be pioneers in distributed renewable energy generation, and the Metro depot power plant allows us to assess our larger potential for in-house generation of renewable energy, says Maija Sarpo, Head of Quality and Environmental Management at HKL.According to an unofficial listing, the HKL plant is Finlands 11th biggest solar power plant and, as such, it is among Finlands 20 biggest solar power plants to date. The power plant is Finlands 9th biggest rooftop solar power plant.The Roihupelto Metro depots annual power consumption is about 4,600 MWh. The new power plant generates 422 MWh of solar power in a year, so it covers close to 10 percent of the depots power consumption. If the solar power plants generation should momentarily exceed the depots consumption, the extra power could be directed to Metro train operation in HKLs own electricity grid, says HKL Project Manager Lasse
Rosenholm, responsible for the power plant implementation.The new solar power plant consists of 1,780 polycrystalline solar panels and 5 solar inverters. Solar inverters convert the direct current (DC) output of solar panels into alternating current for the propertys electrical network.A special feature of the solar power plant is that panels face three directions  east, south and west. This enables the plant to generate more evenly from sunrise to sunset. The plant has extensive smart features, allowing us to monitor output down to the level of single panels. The GEF Vision application allows us to diagnose the operation of the inverters and the whole plant remotely, says Juha Huttunen, a technical specialist for GreenEnergy Finland Oy.The design life of the solar power plant is 30 years or more and could be extended with updates.
Pride Helsinki 2019 takes hold of the city on 2430 June. The City of Helsinki also works to advance equality and non-discrimination for the benefit of its citizens and employees. The Culture and Leisure Division offers a breath-taking variety of events and happenings during the festival week.Helsinki Pride is the major cultural and human rights event for sexual and gender minorities in Finland. The Pride week is full of programmes, such as lectures and debates, workshops, art and culture besides many parties. The event is arranged by the human rights organisation Helsinki Pride community. The climax of the week will be the parade and the park party on Saturday 29 June. The police estimate that about 100,000 people took part in the Pride Parade last year. According to the city strategy, Helsinki is a strong, vibrant and multicultural promoter of liberal democracy and tolerance. A growing Helsinki fosters a culture permitting pluralism and enabling encounters between population groups. Above all, Helsinki is a community. Each Helsinkian is an equal and equally valuable member of this community without regard to background, views, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation. A city where equality prevails is a place where people want to live, start companies, work, learn, play, go to their jobs and raise their families. Every day, Helsinki works to this end. Helsinki Pride on its part is doing important work to advance equality in Helsinki  and is also celebrating what has already been achieved, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Active equality and non-discrimination work in HelsinkiThe City of Helsinki has a long tradition in promoting gender equality, the City has, for instance, had a gender equality committee with elected officials since the mid-1980s. At the same time, it is recognised that fruitful equality and non-discrimination work requires constant development efforts and new initiatives. In the planning period 20192021, among these are the systematic development of gender impact assessment as well as better considering gender diversity in the municipal services and activities. A future objective is to develop the equality and non-discrimination work as a more concise unity for promoting human rights in the services. The personnel gender equality plan was drawn up to guarantee that representatives of all genders are treated equally well in all workplaces of the City of Helsinki. In its capacity as employer, the City expects a business-like and appreciative attitude towards all co-workers and all customers. The measures of the personnel gender equality plan will be updated two years from now. The annual measures of the personnel non-discrimination plan will be updated during this year.In order to promote consistent human rights work, the City of Helsinki set up a human rights network in early 2019. It has been joined by more than 180 members of the municipal staff  from traffic warden to city architect, from information officer to practical nurse, and it meets regularly to come up with ideas and to develop municipal services from the point of view of equality. Earlier this year, Helsinki for the first time asked the city residents how well the city has managed to realise equality and non-discrimination. More than 500 replies were received. They contained valuable information that will contribute to the advancement of equality and the improvement of municipal services. The Culture and Leisure Division offers a breath-taking variety of events during the theme weekDuring Helsinki Pride 2019 festival week, the City of Helsinki will organise events that take place at cultural centres, museums and youth centres. At the museums, there will be e.g. guided tours on the queerness theme as well as singalongs. Visitors may also learn about the Helsinki of the 1920s as perceived by sexual and gender minorities.Further reading:Helsinki Pride communityProgramme offered by the Culture and Leisure Division during the theme weekPride week programme for the young:munstadi.fi Young Pride 2019 programme compilation 2019 (pdf)The City of Helsinki as employerThe Most Functional City in the World  The Helsinki City Strategy 20172021
Climate change is one of the central drivers of change affecting quality of life globally. The city of Helsinki has set an aim to reduce emissions by 60 percent by the year 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2035. This shift requires both major structural changes and everyday actions. Individual choices matter  in order to stop further climate warming, every Finn should reduce their carbon footprint from 10.3 tonnes to 2.5 tonnes by the year 2030.The Think Sustainably service helps to choose more sustainable ways of living in Helsinki and enjoying the city. It filters content from the MyHelsinki.fi website to suggest sustainable services, such as restaurants, shops, sights, events and accommodation.The version launched in June 2019 is a pilot service and it involves a limited number of operators. It will be further developed to include sustainable choices from restaurants to mobility.The base of the service is in tailor-made criteria for the city of Helsinki that have been developed together with the independent think tank Demos Helsinki, along with local interest groups and sustainability experts. The criteria highlight ecological sustainability and specifically address climate change while also considering social sustainability. The purpose of the criteria is to filter out service providers working in a sustainable manner and to encourage operators to develop their function further.Service providers are responsible for evaluating their own services in terms of meeting the criteria in their respective service category. If a service provider meets the minimum requirements in their category, it can then be classified as a sustainable choice on the MyHelsinki portal. The service providers who have met the required criteria are marked with a green tab and website visitors can examine more in-depth which criteria were fulfilled and which not. The purpose is not to pinpoint who are the straight-A students, but rather to encourage different operators to find an impressive array of solutions that encourage customers and visitors to engage in more sustainable lifestyles. The process of developing the service included researching the most significant factors of ecological sustainability related to different service categories. These dealt mostly with greenhouse emissions caused by energy production and the impacts of mobility and food. In addition, waste management, factors related to circular economy, protecting biodiversity, accessibility, employment and preventing discrimination were considered. The criteria, though only in its pilot phase, has already encouraged several service providers to make changes such as switching energy and heating contracts to environmentally friendlier ones.The aim of the criteria was also to be accessible to many different types of service providers because everyone should have the opportunity to be part of a bigger wave of change. True impact is brought about when a large and diverse group participates in it each through their own actions.Customers and visitors can give feedback on the success of the provider through the same website.Read more on MyHelsinki.fi

Helsinki has brought up design competence strongly as a part of the Citys development, international profile and competitiveness. At the same time, the City has profiled itself as a pioneer in expanding the significance of design. Helsinki has initiated a collaboration with the Aalto Universitys Department of Design in order to profoundly evaluate the impact of design in the development of the City. The objective is to produce a review of the different contexts in which design is used in the operations of the City. Another goal is to increase the understanding of how different kinds of design projects can be structured and how the results and learnings of them can be made more visible. The first outcome of the project will be a city design map with descriptions of different project types and their characteristics.Design has made Helsinki into an interesting role model on the world stage. Helsinki is perceived as a city that knows and understands how to make use of design. The city employs a growing number of service designers and development work is also carried out jointly with design agencies, says City Design Manager Pivi Hietanen.Helsinki has more than ten years of experience of utilising design widely in its development activities. To the City, design means human-centred activities, that the citizen perspective is considered in all aspects of service development. Design has also been recognised in the City Strategy as a significant tool for transformation and profiling.Helsinki aims to make the City better and more functional every day. In order to share the best practices, it is essential to highlight new actions and their impact. Here, the evaluation work performed with top researchers in the field plays an important part, describes Hietanen.At the same time, the evaluation is work that supports the learning of the Citys developers.In this way, we create prerequisites for work that is even more impactful. In the background, there was also a need to make a more systematic evaluation of the results gained through design and the organisation's ability and maturity to make use of design, notes Development Consultant Meri Virta at the Helsinki City Executive Office.
One fresh example of service design is the co-design event between the Liikkuvat network and senior citizens, which was arranged at Oodi this spring. The objective was to find new ideas for increasing everyday physical activities among senior citizens.Aalto Universitys Department of Design has collaborated with Helsinki for more than ten years, especially when it comes to questions related to participatory planning and service design. The co-operation has resulted in several publications and theses. At the same time, the utilisation of service design has expanded in Helsinki and the competence has developed rapidly.The City of Helsinki has been an international forerunner in the utilisation of service design. The extent and number of different kinds of projects is considerable. The typification of these and the reviewing of the challenges is extremely interesting in terms of both organisational learning and academic research, says Professor Tuuli Mattelmki, Head of the Department of Design at Aalto University.The report of the first phase of joint development project will be published in October. The city design map will then be further developed together with the students of Aalto University.Further informationCity of Helsinki:City Design Manager Pivi Hietanen, e-mail: paivi.hietanen(at)hel.fi andDevelopment Consultant Meri Virta, e-mail: meri.virta(at)hel.fiAalto University:Head of the Department of Design Professor Tuuli Mattelmki, e-mail: tuuli.mattelmaki(at)aalto.fiProfessor Sampsa Hyysalo, e-mail: sampsa.hyysalo(at)aalto.fiFurther readingDesign HelsinkiDesign Stories from Helsinki

Helsinki wants to be a pioneer for local implementation of global responsibilities. In September 2018, the city, being after New York the second city in the world and the first one in Europe to do so, thus made a commitment to report voluntarily to the UN on its implementation of the sustainable development goals. Helsinki has completed its report, called From Agenda to Action  The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019, and it will be handed over to the UN in July.In 2015, the UN member states came to an agreement on the sustainable development goals and the action plan. The Agenda 2030 action plan is universal and aims at eradicating extreme poverty and advancing sustainable development that equally takes the environment, the economy and people into account. There are in sum 17 sustainable development goals (SDG), and annually a UN high-level political forum specifies the areas of focus whose advancement is the topic of reporting. In 2019, the areas of focus are quality education (SDG4), decent work and economic growth (SDG8), reduction of inequality (SDG10), climate action (SDG13), peace, justice and accountable administration (SDG16), and cooperation and partnership (SDG17).Cities are gaining in importance globally and the objective is to view cities as strategic partners  not only as implementers of the agenda  at all fora where global problems are being solved. The sustainable development goals constitute the universal terms of reference on the basis of which various parties can contribute to this discourse on an equal basis, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.A significant part of the actual implementation of the sustainable development goals take place locally. The cities have a substantial role in achieving the goals. The New York model for local reporting highlights the role of cities both vis--vis the city residents and the global community.The objective of the report has been to generate knowledge about the implementation of sustainable development in Helsinki. The commitment to the process of reporting has enabled Helsinki at the midpoint of the term of its city strategy 20172021 to assess how well the strategic goals serve the UNs sustainable development goals.The process of reporting has also been a means to promote cooperation with the international community, to make other cities commit to assessing and reporting their sustainable development and to influence matters in order to boost the input of cities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals globally. Helsinki cooperated closely with New York City in the course of the entire process.Moreover, a close relationship between the government and the city is a key part of being able to fulfil the sustainable development goals successfully.The Helsinki report, From Agenda to Action  The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019, comes to the conclusion that Helsinki's city strategy is ambitious and wide-ranging and that its goals fit well in with the UN goals for sustainable development. The report manages to illustrate that Helsinki already has carried out or is in the process of carrying out many measures that advance the UN goals at the city level. No substantial deficiencies or gaps in the implementation of the sustainable development areas of focus were found.Even though the reports approach is strategically comprehensive, it nevertheless does not cover the entire range of municipal services or operations. The city promotes the realisation of the UN goals also in many other ways in addition to those that have been given attention in this report. The report states too that it is necessary to develop and improve indicators for the follow-up of the UN goals in connection with possible further reports. As for the follow-up indicators, the challenge is to produce indicators that are comparable. It would also be advantageous to analyse in more detail the points of convergence between on the one hand the targets in connection with the sustainable development goals, and on the other hand the local level activities.In accordance with the results of the report and the questions that have been raised in the wake of the reporting process, the city will develop the deployment of the city strategy in order to realise the sustainable development goals in the municipal organisation as well as possible. The more conscious people are about advancing sustainable development in the tasks they are fulfilling, the more likely it is that they will succeed.Moreover, the city actively communicates the results to its residents and stakeholders to raise consciousness of the importance of the sustainable development goals in the citys day-to-day operations.Helsinki will also carry on being an active international influencer with the aim to persuade other cities to commit themselves to issuing voluntary implementation reports. Jointly with other cities, Helsinki endeavours to influence matters to achieve recognition for the importance of cities in key international fora and networks  and in the UN in particular  and to enable cities to participate in drawing up the agenda and the goals too in the future  and not just in their implementation. Helsinki also actively advances global awareness of the sustainable development goals.From Agenda to Action  The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019 PDFMore information on sustainable development in Helsinki
The C21 Mayors of Finland consider that the implementation of the Government Programme requires a close partnership between the Government and the biggest cities of the country.The programme of Prime Minister Antti Rinnes Government includes many items that can have significant impacts depending on the manner in which those items would be implemented  impacts on the dynamism of cities, the growth opportunities of cities, securing sustainable growth and the organization of services and transport. It is necessary that, as the Government implements the programme, that the Government should do so in close interaction with the countrys biggest cities.The success of the entire country is more than before dependent on how comprehensively the biggest cities can tackle complex challenges ranging from segregation to climate change. It should be a core task of urban policies to ensure that cities have tools to tackle those challenges. This requires a partnership approach and an inclusion of a city policy perspective in all the biggest projects and actions of the Government. Cities cannot be mere objects in the implementation of policies.From the point of view of the C21 network, the Government Programme has both good and worrying elements. Positive elements include the programmes clauses on housing policy and increased contractual cooperation between cities and the Government. Cities are prepared to support the achievement of these goals with their activities. Furthermore, the role of municipalities must be strengthened in the organization of employment services, as stated in the Government Programme. Cities have all the means and the readiness to carry out this task.On a general level, the Government Programme recognizes differences between cities, although concrete measures are lacking. The Government should customize its range of means in urban policies taking into consideration the special needs of cities. This can be accomplished only with city-oriented urban policies, by making use of the expertise of cities and by readjusting the State-oriented angle of approach towards considering how the Government should support and enable cities own development work and activities.The biggest concerns of the Mayors are related to the sustainability of the municipal economy and the reform of social welfare and healthcare. The Government Programme includes many policies concerning increases in or expansion of the tasks and responsibilities of municipalities. These policies would entail considerable costs for municipalities, which would have to be compensated for in their entirety. It is also important that all measures and reforms of the Government Programme should be implemented in an economically sustainable manner and with regard to the municipal economy.In terms of the reform of social welfare and healthcare, the Mayors are concerned that the model proposed by the Government would not solve the key problems of social welfare and healthcare. Most importantly, the reform should focus on the key elements, that is, services and the development of services from the customer point of view. A reform carried out on the municipal basis would be a more controlled and secure manner of reform than the region-based approach and, combined with stronger regulatory control than at present, it would produce results fast in terms of services. The best and customer-oriented solutions do not require the establishment of a new administrative level, and the problems with services are not solved by establishing regions with multiple responsibilities or by introducing a regional tax.The Mayors of C21 cities state that, despite the objectives recorded in the Government Programme, some of them good, to strengthen the abilities of cities to function, the reform of social welfare and healthcare, carried out in the manner proposed by the Government, would diminish the abilities and resources of cities to serve as regional, as local and thus as national engines of growth and their abilities to sustain growth and development.The network of the C21 Mayors comprise the Mayors of Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Oulu, Turku, Jyvskyl, Lahti, Kuopio, Kouvola, Pori, Joensuu, Lappeenranta, Hmeenlinna, Vaasa, Rovaniemi, Seinjoki, Mikkeli, Kotka, Salo and Porvoo. This permanent network of Mayors strengthens discussion on urban policies and the cities joint promotion of interests.Read more:C21 network

For three days, 1113 June 2019, the attention of the worlds digital health experts was focused on Helsinki, as the city hosted Europes leading event in digital health, HIMSS & Health 2.0 European Conference. The selection of Helsinki  for the first time ever  for this international gathering of specialists and visionaries in the future of health is in itself proof of Helsinkis strengths in health innovations. Those strengths form key elements of the future of healthcare.The Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre hosted close to 3,000 experts discussing the latest advances in healthcare  representatives of enterprises, startups, research institutions and healthcare organizations, as well as decision-makers and thought leaders. The Finland Pavilion, the largest country section, presented 80 Finnish enterprises and organizations that together provided a comprehensive cross-section of top Finnish health expertise.
The Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre in Helsinki hosted close to 3,000 health experts

The presentation of the Finland Pavilion both showcased the main themes of the conference and underscored the key roles that Finland plays in those themes: integration of social services and healthcare, community-based care (or home care), secure and ethical flow of data, artificial intelligence and open innovation.

Finland is well positioned to be a key player in the future of health, comments one of the conferences international guests, Patrick Loerch, Ph.D., of World Without Disease Accelerator of Janssen. Janssen is a pharmaceutical company of the American multinational Johnson & Johnson corporation.Patrick Loerch, Ph.D, VP, Global Head Data Sciences & Prevention Biomarkers, World Without Disease Accelerator, JanssenLoerch, titled Vice President and Global Head Data Sciences & Prevention Biomarkers, describes his organizations view of the future of health as follows:Healthcare will continue to evolve rapidly, spurred by deeper understanding of diseases and through the application and integration of data science and new technologies. Our focus at Janssens World Without Disease Accelerator is to move from todays disease care to a future health care paradigm, where solutions maintain health. We see that the priorities are, first, collaboration among the life science ecosystem  that is, patients, physicians, industry, academia, tech, health authorities and payers  and, second, a commitment to accelerate and to deliver transformational innovations that prevent, intercept and cure diseases. We see that the application of AI is a foundational part in this commitment. AI holds great promise and represents an important pillar in our efforts at Janssen.The City of Helsinki and its partners the University of Helsinki and HUS Helsinki University Hospital under the umbrella of Health Capital Helsinki are key collaborators in the HIMSS and Health 2.0 European Conference. They also had an active presence in the 2019 programme and on the exhibition floor.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, Director of Economic Development, explains, Health is a growing economic sector internationally, and health tech is Finlands fastest-growing export business. Health and wellbeing are also a growing industry in Helsinki. We see HIMSS as a good way to support that growth.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, Director of Economic Development, and Juha Paakkola, Director of Health Capital HelsinkiHelsinki will continue to host the conference for another two years  both in 2020 and 2021.HIMSS strengthens Helsinkis brand in health and wellbeing in more ways than one, Rinkineva continues. The fact that we can pull together such a large event as this strengthens our image as a significant player in health, and it proves that Helsinki is developing into a notable health tech hub  a true Health Capital.Furthermore, HIMSS allows us to showcase many of our strengths, including a successful integration of social services and healthcare, and our combination of topnotch medical research and technology. I was happy to see the conferences large attendance, which exceeded our expectations. The overall atmosphere was good. Helsinki will benefit from concrete new international business and partnerships produced as a result of HIMSS. Helsinki Business Hub, an international trade and investment development agency for the Helsinki metropolitan area, focused at the conference on expounding the areas strengths in health. We see HIMSS as a way to create value and as a mechanism to develop investments, says Helsinki Business Hub CEO Marja-Liisa Niinikoski.Our main message is that the future of health can be found and is created in Helsinki. We base this claim on solid arguments, Niinikoski asserts.First, data is the new gold, and its importance will be growing further. Finland is a technology-driven country that has built solid IT expertise over decades. Now data analytics and artificial intelligence competencies combine with top medical research and clinical expertise in Finland, to produce world-leading capabilities in digital health. Digital health solutions enable proactive, preventive and personalized care, which are the future of health.Marja-Liisa Niinikoski, CEO, Helsinki Business Hub (HBH) at the HBH loungeFinland possesses particular strengths in the integration of digital health data with genome information. A prime example cited by Niinikoski is FinnGen, a major public-private collaboration based at the University of Helsinki.Another prime example of Finlands strengths in digital health cited by Niinikoski is iCAN, also based at the University of Helsinki. iCAN combines precision cancer medicine and digital health. Niinikoski underscored her declaration that the future of health is made in Helsinki with a panel discussion on the digital twin concept in healthcare, held on the Stage of the conference exhibition floor. Five panelists envisioned uses of this concept, new in health, from the patient point of view. If we can produce a digital twin of a human being, we can make major advances in preventive healthcare, Niinikoski commented.

After an intense tour of the HIMSS exhibition floor on Day One of the exhibition, Visa Honkanen, Chief Digital Officer of HUS Helsinki University Hospital, commented that he felt like having been on a campaign trail. But were all marketers. We should take our expertise further in order to help others in Finland to move on. The HUS competencies should benefit all of Finland. HUS, the biggest healthcare provider in Finland, is part of the Health Capital Helsinki alliance.Visa Honkanen, Chief Digital Officer of HUS Helsinki University HospitalHonkanen had begun his tour in the morning by accepting a HIMSS award, HIMSS-Elsevier Digital Healthcare Award for Outstanding ICT Achievement, conferred to the Health Village virtual hospital, a national Finnish project that was initiated by HUS but today includes all Finnish university hospitals.The 16,500 monthly visitors to Health Village exemplify why Finland, according to an EU estimate, is Europes Number One country in digitalization, Honkanen says. HUS conducts pioneering work to digitalize healthcare with digital care pathways. Elaborating on leadership in digital health, Honkanen points out, however, that it would require a thorough cultural change to make digital care pathways the primary pathways.Digitalization is a good thing, but it should always be complemented by personal encounters the combination of digital care and personal encounters is key to super-efficient healthcare. Thats the grand idea behind digital health. When we develop AI-based solutions in healthcare, its not enough to have the best data scientist and the best clinician they have to be integrated to create added value. Thats where Finland excels: the creation of this added value, coupled with vast amounts of data and, importantly, trust. Finnish society is based on trust, and Finnish customers are confident that their data is treated with respect. The trust comes from the high achievements of the Finnish education system, which produces sophisticated customers. Digitalization is the faster and the more successful the more trust there is in society.To sum up, Finland excels in health because we have the three essentials in place: tools, rules and schools  the technology to analyze data, the rules that govern the use of data, and a high-achieving education system. Timo Lukkarinen, City of Helsinki Medical Director, took the Stage to complete Day One on the exhibition floor. He highlighted how Helsinki public healthcare points to the future of health.Timo Lukkarinen, Medical Director, City of HelsinkiLukkarinen presented a system of health benefit analysis applied by Helsinki using a special tool developed in Finland to analyze the care history of patients. The tool uses all indicators and data recorded on patients over their entire history of public healthcare, such as smoking habits. The data analysis can be used to produce preventive and personalized care solutions. The tool can pick out subgroups of patients at risk and allow targeted care to be directed at those groups. The tool shows the power of data analytics in public healthcare. It has the power to revolutionize public health, Lukkarinen envisions.Helsinki Business Hub continued its exploration of the future of health with a panel discussion on the morning of Thursday, 13 June, focusing on shared decision-making by using AI.The discussion was inspired by an AI-powered tool developed by Solita, a company that specializes in digital transformation, and the Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement. The new tool can revolutionize the work of surgeons. It supports doctors in making decisions and helps them to evaluate treatment methods and risks related to surgery. But questions arise when medical decision-making is transferred to a machine.Solitas Director of Health and Wellbeing Division, Risto Kaikkonen, comments, Such systems represent dramatic transformation in healthcare. AI makes healthcare more efficient, but AI-based systems introduce new aspects to healthcare to consider, ranging from legal aspects to ethics to consumer markets.Risto Kaikkonen, Solitas Director of Health and Wellbeing DivisionThe Helsinki Business Hubmoderated panel tackled those aspects, continuing to make the future of health in Helsinki.More informationHIMSS & Health 2.0 European ConferenceHIMSS  Healthcare Information and Management Systems SocietyHelsinki Business Hub  HealthHealth Capital Helsinki

The City of Helsinki Audit Committee observed things to fix and develop, for example, in the realisation of mental health services for children and adolescents. In its Annual Assessment Report, the audit committee recommends that the City reorganises its operations and, if necessary, allocates additional resources in order to set up a unit for the evaluation and treatment of minor and intermediate mental health problems among children and adolescents. The unit would also function as a location for special health care follow-up treatment.Furthermore, a joint appraisal of the mental health services for children and adolescents was made together with the cities of the Helsinki Capital Region and HUS. As part of the appraisal, it was observed that the service system is patchy, particularly in Helsinki. Helsinki lacks an authority responsible for the mental health services for children and adolescents, which would be able to offer psychiatric outpatient treatment in cases of minor or intermediate disturbances. It was recommended that Helsinkis social services and health care division and education division work together to appoint a person in charge of the co-ordination of the services. The divisions must also improve the availability of mental health services in school and student health care. The co-operation with HUS should be increased to ease the shortage of doctors and to develop the care pathway in adolescent psychiatry.In its 2018 Annual Assessment Report, the Helsinki Audit Committee processes 18 different topics and proposes 49 recommendations in total. The recommendations concern, among other things, development of primary education and informal care, as well as increased efficiency in carrying out the emissions reductions. The pupils need for remedial instruction and special support has increased. The principals of primary schools find that more special education teachers are needed in the schools. Based on the assessment, the schools need extra resources when the number of pupils in need of remedial instruction and special support increases. The pupils in need of support are located especially in the northern and north-eastern areas. The need for additional support exists in better-off areas and less multicultural school areas as well. The supply of services in support of informal care for people aged over 65 is more extensive in Helsinki than what is prescribed by law, but the supply does not entirely match the needs of the customers. An essential problem is that the system of time-off and substitutes for informal caregivers does not work as the informal caregivers would like it to. The Audit Committee notes that the share of informal care has dropped in Helsinki and it has not been possible to increase its attractiveness among other forms of care. It is important that opportunities to be an informal caregiver are communicated more extensively, for example, to working people. At the same time, the accessibility of informal care services should be improved, for example, by arranging transports to the services. The City of Helsinki has not yet managed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions substantially, although many measures have been taken. In the City Strategy, Helsinki has set a 60 percent emissions reduction goal for the year 2030 and a carbon neutrality goal for the year 2035. In its Annual Assessment Report, the Audit Committee states that the City must increase its co-operations in the implementation of the emissions reduction with the business sector, the residents of the city and the housing cooperatives. The achievement of the reduction goals for transportation emissions should be furthered by more efficient means.The Audit Committee is an organ that reports to the City Council and whose task is to assess the extent to which the goals set by the City Council have been fulfilled. The 2018 Annual Assessment Report can be read at: www.arviointikertomus.fi.The City Council will process the Assessment Report at its meeting on 19 June 2019.Further information:Dan Koivulaakso, Chair of the Audit Committee, 044 5066 613, dan.koivulaakso@gmail.comTimo Terv, Audit Director, 050435 7547, timo.terava@hel.fi2018

Once again, Helsinki Startup Day was a success. More than one thousand people had registered and those who participated in the event praised the diverse programme and also the sense of community. People felt welcome, whether they were sent by a small startup enterprise or by a company that is already well on its way to growth.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, who is Helsinkis director of economic development, reiterated in her opening remarks that the organisers of this and the previous event had intended it as an opportunity for local startup players to get together.This year, the organisers wanted to include young companies from the other Nordic countries and the Baltic States, i.e. the New Nordics area. Now, the event themes were games as well as health and wellness.As the world is shrinking, the competition is getting tougher. Rinkineva asserted that Helsinki is already a veteran startup city, but to be successful globally, bigger players are needed. For the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, it would pay off to rally together and to expand the companies and the market to dimensions that are large even in a European perspective.There is clearly a big demand for this kind of event, said Tommo Koivusalo, head of NewCo Helsinki, and Marja-Leena Rinkineva, director of economic development.The idea is to give the participants all at once a comprehensive grip on the Helsinkian startup scene, new and useful information and valuable new connections. The timing of the event, i.e. the first week of June, has been chosen quite on purpose, as that is the super week of international startup events in Helsinki. We in the municipal organisation do not start up businesses, but we can create the best imaginable business environment. This is what we work for, and that is what Startup Day is about, Rinkineva concludes.All startup companies and everybody with an interest in joining the ecosystem was eligible to participate in the event programme, as the organisers wanted to enable entrance to all interested.Rinkineva pointed out that the Finnish gaming industry is world-famous, but that there was now great potential in health care.Therefore, she was pleased with the fact that companies representing both industries but also interested investors were in attendance in such large numbers.Aside from speeches, the Startup Day programme included, among other things, workshops and speed business meetings.Head of unit Tommo Koivusalo reminded the participants of the notion that no one is able to succeed on his own. Particularly in the modern world, you cannot advance without access to networks.Koivusalo asserted that there is an abundance of confidence in the worlds happiest country. This facilitates communication and network building substantially. In Helsinki, these are sought after, especially coupled with Scandinavians and people from the Baltic States. NewCo Helsinki is a great place to work, because there our job is to help new entrepreneurs and enterprises, Koivusalo added glowingly.Rinkineva and Koivusalo hypothesised that the popularity of the event is a sign of the community spirit of startup companies in the Helsinki Capital Region. People have a need to meet others, to make contact and to find new ideas, Rinkineva said. There is an urge to work together here. There is an intimate atmosphere and people are prepared to share information. Why not describe this as startup casual? Koivusalo suggested.Another sign of the community spirit was a piece of news that broke that day. The community of gaming companies in the Capital Region is about to establish a new gaming association that will promote the growth and culture of gaming companies. Joint voluntary work will make the association come true and keep it running.The programme of the event included several interesting speeches. Svein Berg of Nordic Innovation, who was one of the anticipated speakers, underlined the importance of scale-ups, i.e. growth-oriented companies.Svein Berg encouraged startups to grow.Nordic Innovation sets innovations in motion and finances them. Its key partners are Nordic small and medium-size businesses. It has also teamed up with Maria 01, which is a cluster of Helsinkian startup and growth companies. As much as we are talking about startups, we as nations need growing companies above all.He thinks that the Nordic countries and the Baltic States form a region that has everything that is needed to generate even fast business growth. There is a business-friendly atmosphere, there is no corruption and the infrastructure works.According to statistics, in years 20132016 the Nordic scale-ups generated 200,000 new jobs.He pointed out that nobody was born to lead a growth company. The entrepreneurs need acceleration programmes and mentoring. It is an excellent thing that we are able to join forces, share information and support entrepreneurship, Berg asserts.Christine Ritter came from Denmark to talk about acceleration programmes. She summed up the three greatest needs of startups: they should get assistance to obtain funding, to recruit staff and to find suitable facilities and equipment.Christine Ritter thinks it would be excellent for startup enterprises to be provided with facilities and equipment.Olavi Mertanen, of FiBAN that represents business angels, had one of the most popular workshops of the event. He stayed on to answer questions still a long time after closing up shop.Mertanen made the point that a good startup will still be able to obtain funding, even though economic growth is expected to slow down. There are plenty of interesting enterprises in the Capital Region. Personally, I follow keenly what is going on with the education startups that get a tailwind from the good reputation of the Finnish education system.According to Mertanens shortlist of keys to success, you need a good business idea, and in addition to that, a well-functioning network and the capacity to introduce the story of the company, as demanded, in three minutes, or in two or one, in Finnish and in English. The story can never be too good, you should invest yourself in it with due care.Olavi Mertanen of FiBAN that represents business angels set up a very popular workshop.Startup Estonia's Maarika Truu gave a talk about the situation for startups in Estonia. She assured that funding is to be found for good ideas and talents in Estonia as well. We have about 550 startups, which is a lot for a country of 1.3 million inhabitants. Soon startups will employ approximately 5,000 people, and our companies too do suffer from a shortage of labour.Maarika Truu talked about the Estonian startups and their situation.Truu reminded that the Nordic countries and Estonia have cooperated previously as well. For instance, Skype was set up jointly by the Swedes, the Danes and the Estonians.There is strength in cooperation, emphasised Suvi Latva of Baltic Games Industry and Per Strmbck of Dataspelsbranschen, who were interviewed as part of a panel discussion.Strmbck made the audience laugh when he stated that the Swedes love the Finns in particular: In case the Swedes do not win the hockey games themselves, they want the Finns to come out as winners.Suvi Latva and Per Strmbck on stage being interviewed by Koopee Hiltunen (centre).Taina Myhnen gave a presentation about the recently established Women in Games Finland association, which works for diversity within the gaming industry. The community was originally a Facebook group, but as the number of followers had reached one thousand plus, an association was set up.In spite of its name, the association does not promote the female angle only, but rather diversity more generally.Myhnen points out that there are many hidden jobs in the gaming industry. The management recruits people from among their acquaintances, or then friends of friends are selected to fill vacancies, and so diverse backgrounds are not perceived as a plus for game development.Taina Myhnen provided a reminder of the great benefits of diversity to the gaming industry.Information was disseminated also unofficially, in the corridors and during the quarters of an hour of speed meetings. The speed meetings or matchmaking was one of the most successful parts of the big event, as about 700 bilateral meetings took place. Some had set up meetings already in advance and some were set up in the course of the day based on data from the matching system.The participants gave much praise for the 15-minute meetings, and many had several. One of them was Jesse Tran, who had made quite a few inspiring appointments on behalf of his Rens Coffee Shoes Company, which produces running shoes from coffee grounds and recycled plastics.Jesse Tran introduced shoes produced by his enterprise, Rens Coffee Shoes, to Truc Doan.Fedor Tyurin addressed some questions about Maria 01 to Tiina Nyman. The startup cluster had attracted Tyurins attention, as he had heard about it from other young enterprises and was aware that many talented people have come together in the facilities of what formerly was a hospital.Fedor Tyurin of Enable Banking wanted to know more about Maria 01. Tiina Nyman explains.Tyurin had come to Startup Day to network. Even his colleagues had pushed him to get moving to reach out to people as he otherwise spends most of his working days in the company of his laptop.The Barracuda Disaster was appreciative as well. This enterprise develops a comedic game for childlike adults. It was excellent to get here, because we need people to test the game and then we collect their feedback, Henri Taussi explained.The enterprise is also on the lookout for a publisher and for funding. Taussi thinks it is great that Helsinki Startup Day is open to everybody without an entry fee.Jenni Pennanen, Henri Taussi and Teemu Viisanen of Barracuda Disaster had the opportunity to collect feedback from gamers.Roshnii Chou of the recently established company Peaso described her mood as that of being extremely impressed. She wanted to find out whom of the City of Helsinki staff she should thank for the event.Peasos Roshnii Chou at a speed meeting with Otso Mursula of KP Health wanted to know whether she would be able to use the latter companys laboratory for testing.Chous company is geared towards the health and wellness industry and reforms the Japanese miso soup to be Western, gluten-free and completely vegan. Her goal is to export new Nordic style health food to all of Europe. She had a speed meeting with e.g. Otso Mursulan of Kp Health. Here, I got completely new ideas and new perspectives on how to develop a company, Chou rounded off.Original text in Finnish: Kirsi RiipinenImages: Ilkka Ranta-ahoFurther readingNewCo HelsinkiMaria 01

release (in Finnish).At its meeting of 5 June, the City Council discussed the Citys environmental activities and the implementation of the Helsinki City Strategy in connection with the consideration of the newly released edition of the annual City of Helsinki Environmental Report.
Helsinki is making good progress, as greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 27 percent from 1990 and emissions per capita by as much as 45 percent. Helsinkis goal is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 1990 to 2020 and by 60 percent from 1990 to 2030, and Helsinki seeks to become carbon neutral by 2035. These goals are ambitious, but they can be achieved, states Deputy Mayor Anni Sinnemki.
The Citys total environmental expenses for 2018 were EUR 91 million. The biggest expenses were caused by air protection (33 percent), area maintenance and waste management (23 percent) and promotion of climate- and environment-friendly mobility (18 percent).Environmental investments totalled EUR 135 million, which represents 21.5 percent of all investments in fixed assets.The Environmental Report is a joint report for the whole City Group. It details the Citys achievement of its environmental goals and the impact of operations on the environment. It is also a monitoring report on the Citys environmental policies, assessing the achievement of the goals defined in the Helsinki City Strategy. The report, totalling 72 pages, outlines the Citys operations and achievements in air protection, in transport and traffic and in water protection, among other areas of operation.A proposal by Councillor Sirpa Asko-Seljavaara was approved in connection with the consideration of the Environmental Report to the effect that the City should investigate how to avoid dumping snow from snow removal operations into the sea as early as next winter. The City Council also approved a proposal by Atte Kaleva to the effect that the City should pay special attention to the protection of diverse biotopes maintained by the grassland network and grasslands.All City Council decisions of the meeting of 5 June 2019 are listed on the meeting release (in Finnish).The City Council voting maps and other information on the Council meeting, as well as a video recording of the Council meeting, are available on the Citys web channel at www.helsinkikanava.fiEnvironmental Report 2018 (in Finnish)


  Helsinki Day has been celebrated for 60 years already. The programme has been created by local residents and this year it highlights topical themes such as responsibility and climate change.
  Helsinki will be filled with a festival atmosphere on the citys birthday, 12 June, with over a hundred individual events spread out across dozens of districts and neighbourhoods. The programme includes art and music, sports and exercise, guided tours, workshops and garden parties. All of the events are free of charge and open to all. This years programme includes lots to do also for senior citizens. No less than three of the citys service centres are participating by organising, for example, theatre performances and festivals for elderly people. The programme also highlights the themes of responsibility and climate change, says Marianne Saukkonen, Executive Producer from the Helsinki Event Foundation.The environmental theme will be seen throughout Helsinki: people can play a climate change game on their phones by the Tlnlahti bay, surplus food will be reutilised at a picnic in Lapinlahti, and kids can build machines to improve the world at City Hall. Event continues to grow year after year Helsinki Day has expanded with each year, offering an increasingly diverse programme along the way. While the event is coordinated by the City of Helsinki, the programme itself is designed by local residents. Helsinki Day is all about the people of the city, so the programme offers something for everyone  from theatre orienteering to traditional games and 1920s-style public exercises to robot bus rides. Helsinki Day is a communal and participatory festival that involves dozens of local associations, businesses and residents. It encourages people to do things and experience them together. The day also nurtures local pride among residents while introducing our districts and neighbourhoods to visitors, Saukkonen says. As in previous years, a jury of local influencers awarded production grants to almost twenty Helsinki Day events on the basis of applications. The members of this years jury were Pauli Saloranta, Teemu Lehto, Renaz Ebrahimi, Sonja Kailassaari, Mari Nieminen, Max TalviOja, Mirja Arajrvi and Marianne Saukkonen. The programme for Helsinki Day, which has been held since 1959, includes such classic events as morning coffees with the mayor and award ceremonies for City Slang man and woman of the year and local athletes of the year. The day traditionally culminates with a free concert in Kaisaniemi Park featuring top Finnish artists. Helsinki Day is a programme of events that is organised annually on 12 June.

An idea competition for the Lapinlahti hospital area has been organised to find a new purpose of use and owner for the buildings in the area. The deadline for the proposals was 31 May 2019. Altogether, four proposals had been received by the deadline.The competition consists of two stages. Over the summer, an assessment panel shall select three proposals to advance to the second phase of the competition. In addition to selling the property, proposals based on the option of renting the premises are also included in the competition.The assessment panel will begin its work before Midsummer, and we hope to be able to decide on the proposals that will advance to the second phase by early autumn. We will review all proposals and assess them based on the criteria specified in the competition programme. The final decision on the winner is made by the City Council. I hope that the assessment panel conducts a lively and open discussion to find the best solution, says Head of Department Mikko Aho, who is in charge of the assessment panel. The second phase of the competition is estimated to start in the autumn of 2019. Residents of Helsinki will have the chance to provide feedback on the proposals that advance to the second phase in the Kerrokantasi online service, once the finalists have been selected.The goal is to have the proposals ready for the City Council to make its decision in 2020. After this, the process of possibly updating the city plan is set to start based on the winning proposal. The repair and construction work on the real estate is estimated to start in 2021.Lapinlahti Hospital, completed in 1841, is the oldest psychiatric hospital in Finland. Both the main building designed by C. L. Engel and the surrounding park are protected. The park will remain in the ownership of the City and it will be kept as a public area. In 2015, the City rented Lapinlahti Hospital temporarily to the Lapinlahden tilajakamo co-operative and the Finnish Association for Mental Health, which is the background organisation of Lapinlahden Lhde, a non-profit organisation. The Lapinlahden tilajakamo co-operative and Lapinlahden Lhde will continue their operations in the hospital premises as tenants of the City until a new owner has been found. Read more:
Cycling is becoming an increasingly popular mode of transport in Helsinki, but the change is slower than planned.The number of bicycle journeys made at the borders of Helsinkis inner city area have been on the rise for several years. Last year, more than one million bike trips were made along the countrys busiest cycling route, Lauttasaari Bridge, as well as through Hesperia Park near the National Opera and across Pitksilta Bridge. However, while the number of cycling journeys has increased, the proportion cycling accounts for of all transport has not increased as planned. Helsinkis goal is to have 15per cent of all journeys made by bike by 2020. Last year, the figure was 11per cent.The promotion of cycling is not an end in itself rather, it is a means of creating a safer, more comfortable and more functional urban environment. The more people travel on foot, by bicycle or by public transport, rather than by car, the greater the number of people who can efficiently move about the city, says the Citys cycling coordinator Reetta Keisanen.In order to increase the proportion cycling makes up of all transport, Helsinki will build new, high-quality cycle routes. Over the next few years, the main focus will be on the inner city, because the bike routes connectivity issues are most notable there. The new inner-city bike route network is intended to be finished by the end of 2025. This year, cycle routes will be constructed on Mechelininkatu, Tukholmankatu and Paciuksenkatu. The renovation work on Hmeentie began this spring, and the new cycle routes there will be completed next year.In addition to the routes in the inner city, the construction of the Baana network will continue. The building projects for the Baana underpass underneath the Central Railway Stations tracks, Viikinbaana and Itbaana in Kulosaari will begin next year. The planned length of the finished Baana network is 130kilometres. So far, six kilometres of Baana routes, i.e. less than one kilometre per year, have been completed since 2012. When it comes to factors that affect the cycling experience amongst the Citys residents, exceptional cycling route arrangements during roadworks cause the most dissatisfaction. On the other hand, residents are increasingly satisfied with the combination of cycling and public transport. A total of 94per cent of Helsinkis residents support to the promotion of cycling.For many Helsinkians, bicycles are a common way of getting from point A to point B. During the seasons without snow, more than half of the Citys residents ride a bicycle weekly, Reetta Keisanen says. In May, the City of Helsinki published a leaflet called Bicycle Account 2019. This document discusses the development of bike travel, resident opinions regarding cycling, cycling plans and construction projects. Printed versions are available at the central library Oodis urban environment participatory facility Brygga, among other places. Further

What if future Helsinki would offer a possibility to celebrate a night
of the galleries or participate in late evening meditation in school gyms? Or to tour the archipelago on a nightly sea cruise and to go to the
swimming pool at four in the morning? The possibilities of Helsinki's evening
and night are discussed in a report ordered by the City of Helsinki Culture and
Leisure Division, which was published today. 
An interesting nightlife is an essential part of a citys attractiveness. In spring 2018, a group of night-time operators in Helsinki gathered to discuss the development of the Citys nightlife. The briefings by the night mayors of Amsterdam and Berlin and the joint discussions resulted in the thought that Helsinki could also gain more from its nightlife.Based on the meeting, the City of Helsinki's Culture and Leisure Division commissioned a report on the potential of the Citys nightlife from the perspective of the service producers. The report, published today, includes an array of actions through which Helsinkis night could send a message of an international and attractive City. All the service producers who participated in the report recognised a lot of unused potential in the night of Helsinki. The result does not surprise me. Nightly Helsinki cannot be overlooked  people want to live during the nights as well, notes Helsinki Deputy Mayor Nasima Razmyar. Helsinki is an international and modern large city, which also includes a lively urban life during night-time. As we create more opportunities for work, services, events and hobbies, we need to make sure that this can be realised safely and without causing disturbances. In the most functional City in the world, the nightlife must also be good life for everyone, emphasises Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Less
bureaucracy and more courage wanted from CityIn the report, it is suggested that the City prepares a night strategy and vision together with the service producers. New nightlife initiatives could initially be tested to a restricted extent in terms of area, division and time, for example through a monthly night of the museums or in specific night neighbourhoods. A lot of potential was also seen in the contrast between light and darkness in Helsinki, the nightless summer nights and the darkness of the winter.
As for the City of Helsinkis role, the service producers expressed wishes related to everyday bureaucracy, such as development of the licence procedures for nightly activities and distinct contact persons at the City. Financial support and assistance in communications and marketing for evening and night event trials was also on the list.The City should also show courage in developing unique night-time events in Helsinki. Furthermore, the service producers wanted the City to pay attention to the functionality of the night-time traffic and the Citys security during night as well.Helsinki
hires a night liaisonThe City will hire a night liaison to coordinate the nightlife trials and opportunities. At the beginning of my term, I spoke about a night mayor. Now Helsinki has decided to join that group of international cities, who have recognised the importance of evening and night-time and hired a specific person for the purpose somewhere it is a night tsar, somewhere a night mayor, while we have a night liaison, cheers Deputy Mayor Razmyar.
 The night liaison hired by Helsinki works as an interpreter and voice between the developers of the nightlife in Helsinki and the City of Helsinki. The liaisons task is, above all, to recognise, assist and gather the makers of Helsinki, who want to develop the evenings and nights of Helsinki into something funnier, more eventful and safer.The recruitment process will start in the autumn and the fixed-term assignment runs through June 2021. The night liaison will work at the City Executive Office Communications unit, whose responsibility it is to coordinate the development of the Citys event scene.The report was made by LiveFIN ry on commission of the City of Helsinki Culture and Leisure Division in December 2018 and January 2019. For the report, the makers interviewed the City of Helsinkis external service producers, e.g. in trade, music festivals, restaurant business and sports, accommodation and traffic services as well as museum and performing arts actors.Link to the study (in Finnish)

The English section of Helsinki-lehtis new edition presents climate-smart Kuninkaantammi and the services of Helsinkis public playgrounds including Finnish-language instruction for immigrant families.
As Helsinki starts to implement an action plan to render the city carbon neutral by 2035, the city draws up other plans to prepare for climate change. The northern-Helsinki residential district of Kuninkaantammi is a pilot area for climate-smart planning and development. One of the solutions piloted in the area is a stormwater management system built with water and green elements.Our solutions in Kuninkaantammi prevent urban flooding, and they also create a nature-themed and pleasant living environment, says Kuninkaantammis principal planner Suvi Tyynil.Cities are built with the future in mind, Tyynil says. She asserts, The climate has already changed and will be changing further.Helsinkis 66 public playgrounds are open to all  from toddlers to seniors  providing activities for children and offering company for grownups. In summer they serve free meals to all children and young people.It is important, especially for immigrants, to realize that public playgrounds are free of charge. It may be difficult for immigrants to understand that, as free playgrounds are rare on a global scale, says playground supervisor Amin Rashid at Playgound Kurkimki.
One of the free-of-charge services of public playgrounds is Finnish-language instruction at informal and social Kotoklubi Kaneli club meetings. The meetings are open to all parents of small children irrespective of their previous Finnish-language skills.Social advisor
  Kirsi-Marja Hyvnen says, Kotoklubi Kaneli requires no enrolment, and people can come when it suits their schedules. The purpose is to learn everyday vocabulary and spoken-Finnish expressions. Today 18 Helsinki public playgrounds hold Kotoklubi Kaneli meetings, and summer meetings are held at 12 playgrounds.Read the above articles and more in Helsinki-lehti.
An award jury of ProCom  the Finnish Association of Communications Professionals has awarded their title Leader of the Year to Helsinkis Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The jury based its choice of Vapaavuori on his modern way of using information and communication as a crucial asset for policy-making, and his ability to find the most functional solutions and apply them skilfully to the benefit of the city. For example, Vapaavuori does not have demonstrators chased off the streets but, instead, he sees such activities as part of a functional democracy. Engaging in a broad discussion about city and country brand, Jan Vapaavuori has taken the City of Helsinki and its brand image to a new level. Helsinki possibly never before had such a strong and brave figurehead in the field of information and communication. In particular, Vapaavuori is a skilful user of social media and networks.

Tram routes 2 and 7 will not operate to Lnsi-Pasila between 3 June and 11 August. They will run on special routes: Route 2 runs to Meilahti to the end loop of Kuusitie and route 7 ends in It-Pasila. Bus line 2X replaces the tram route from Kansanelkelaitos stop to Pasila.These special routes of tram lines 2 and 7 and the route of the replacement bus 2X are presented inHRTs traffic bulletin.Additionally, routes 7 and 9 will not operate to Pasila station between 29 July and 11 August due to work on the tracks. More details on this will be provided during the summer.The worksite also affects car traffic, as lanes switch places in the Pasilansilta and Ratapihantie junction. The new lane arrangements have been clearly marked on the road. The number of lanes will mostly remain the same.The reason for these traffic arrangements is the worksite of the new public transport terminal.The construction of the new public transport terminal in Pasilansilta proceeds rapidly. The old tracks of Pasila public transport terminal will be disassembled during the summer, the old bridge deck will be repaired and the new tracks installed, says Project Manager Juuso Luoto, describing the work to be done during the summer.During the tram transport shutdown, water pipe and district heating connections will be built under Pasilankatu, at Kyllikinportti, which also causes disruptions to traffic. Drivers are recommended to avoid driving in the Pasila area the entire summer if alternative routes are possible.The Pasilansilta public transport terminal will be commissioned in late October 2019. When the construction is finished, the new junction area and the public transport terminal will better serve the traffic flows in the entire developing Pasila area.The renewal of Keski-Pasila is a part of the comprehensive renewal project of Pasila, in which the city centre of Helsinki will expand into Pasila. In future years, Pasila will develop into an increasingly significant and livelier centre, thanks to notable new construction and transportation projects in the area. The new Pasila will offer spaces for working, living and recreation. Currently, there are 23,000 jobs and 10,000 residents in Pasila, and in 2040 these numbers will be 50,000 jobs and 30,000 residents.

Funded within the Percent for Art programme, the new public artwork is a large relief that takes its inspiration from the cuckoo clock. Artist Maria Stereos four-metre bronze sculpture Timeless will be installed in the courtyard of the citys Adult Education Institute on Teollisuuskatu in Vallila on Tuesday, 4 June.
There are no hands on the face of the decorative clock, and the cuckoos door remains closed. Just as the title implies, the work is timeless: the clockface does not indicate the hour. Artist Maria Stereo says that timelessness gives viewers a chance to relax. You dont always have to know what the time it is.Ive always been fascinated by domestic kitsch objects and decorations. When I began to explore online images of cuckoo clocks, I found myself in a fantastic world of the most diverse carpentry skills. The fascination carried me into creating a series of clocks using all kinds of mixed media. The works in the series represented autobiographical points in time for me, as it were. One of the clocks was cast in type metal, and that piece eventually triggered the idea for Timeless, the artist says.Last September, a work by artist Anssi Kasitonni was installed in the same site. Similarly produced under the Percent for Art programme, the work, entitled Epifania de Liberace, is a glittering grand piano that seems to be descending from the ceiling among a rain of glitter.Maria Stereo (b. 1979 in Rauma) has had solo exhibitions in Gallery Huuto in Helsinki and Mltinranta in Tampere. She has also participated in numerous group exhibitions. Alongside her work as a visual artist, Stereo also makes music with her band Maria ja Marsilaiset (Maria and the Martians). Anssi Kasitonni (b. 1978 in Vilppula) works with sculpture, video and music, combining popular culture imageries with a DIY attitude. Stereo and Kasitonni live and work in Sahalahti, Kangasala.The City of Helsinki follows the Percent for Art principle under which roughly one percent of the cost of the construction of new properties or the renovation of old ones is earmarked for public art. Helsinki Art Museum HAM serves as the art expert in these projects, and the works are accessioned to the art collection of HAM.Read more:
