The campaign reframed the value that Helsinki offers to its “users” (current citizens) and potential “demo users” (tech professionals looking to relocate) using familiar vocabulary and tone of voice for international tech professionals. The campaign received close to 7,000 applications of tech professionals interested to relocate to Helsinki.Now Helsinki is bringing its potential tech professionals to visit the city. Tech talent from Tel Aviv to New York will experience their potential new hometown Helsinki and its work-life balance during one of the world’s largest startup events, Slush, on 19–22 November. The visit is hosted by City of Helsinki along with Supercell, Smartly, Slush, Relex, and MaaS Global (Whim). “Finding the best talent in the world is critical for us and other tech companies in Helsinki. It is a great place to live and work, with the best education system, best healthcare, opportunities to families, amazing international companies and happiest people in the world! It is easy to demonstrate that when we bring people here,” says Kristo Ovaska, CEO of Smartly.The campaign turned city into a digital product of this decade and pitched Helsinki as a Service, highlighting its multiple perks: Helsinki’s 640,000 daily active users, key features such as free world-class education and healthcare. Helsinki’s bugs – darkness, snow and the flat skyline – were mentioned as carefully considered features. The city’s Mayor Jan Vapaavuori was recruited to act as the CEO of CaaS, encouraging potential demo users to apply for a free demo trip to Helsinki during Europe’s leading startup event Slush. The stunt was described as clever and engaging by Trendwatching and chosen as their Innovation of the Day. The results speak for themselves. In less than a month Helsinki received close to 7,000 applications from the wished target group of professionals in tech from software engineers, developers, AI researchers etc. “Helsinki has all it takes to make you feel like home but the problem was, not too many knew about its beautiful features. To make the world aware of what Helsinki has to offer, the city just needed a little repackaging.” says Alexander Pihlainen, CEO of brand company Boubehind the creative concept. This year the Finnish growth companies attracted the most venture capital investments to GDP in Europe, and hundreds of millions of euros in foreign capital have been invested in startups here. With a new approach to branding Helsinki, the city wants to improve the city’s image as a place to live. “Helsinki is located in one of the world's most secure countries and inhabited by the world’s happiest people. The majority of foreign experts who have settled in Helsinki are satisfied with the quality of life here. The experience of a happy, good life is a combination of tangible – like housing, transportation, jobs and infrastructure – and intangible things. The intangibles – sense of trust and community, equality, closeness to nature – are essential values in building the quality of life”, says Jan Vapaavuori, Mayor of Helsinki.Campaign site: www.myhelsinki.fi/caas\", 'Helsinki cycling routes within the programme of enhanced winter maintenance will expand eastward as far as Itäkeskus and Laajasalo. Additional funds are proposed for enhanced winter maintenance of pedestrian routes.The total length of routes in the enhanced winter maintenance programme is 40.8 kilometres in the winter season 2019–2020. Snow-sweeping and de-icing are used for winter maintenance on a 25.2-kilometre stretch of the routes. Enhanced ploughing is used on the 5.9-kilometre waterfront track Rantaratareitti. The new eastern route is maintained using a combination of snow-sweeping and biodegradable potassium formate (9.7 kilometres).“The route to the east has been requested in many feedback messages to us, so it’s magnificent that we’re now able to provide the extension to the network,” says the walking and cycling project manager Antti Takkunen, pleased with the new maintenance services.Snow-sweeping and de-icing combined are an efficient method of keeping bikeways ice-free and safe. The method also improves bikeway safety and usability in spring, as there is no gravel on surfaces to remove. As the use of gravel is reduced, road and street dust – a springtime phenomenon – is also reduced.Snow-sweeping alone without de-icing would not be a sufficient winter maintenance method for bikeways, as bikeway surfaces would easily remain icy and dangerous. Therefore de-icing or some other method to control slipperiness is necessary. In the future, the City will optimize the use of de-icing salts with the help of increasingly accurate traffic conditions reporting in order to avoid excessive use of de-icing salts.New routes on Itäväylä and in Herttoniemi–Laajasalo will be maintained by snow-sweeping and de-icing, but slipperiness will be controlled with potassium formate instead of salt. Potassium formate works like a salt solution, but it is biodegradable so it does not end up in groundwater. The compound was first tested in winter 2015–2016, when it was discovered to be as effective as the salt solution. The 2020 budget proposal by the City Board to the City Council includes additional funding for enhanced winter maintenance of key pedestrian routes.The proposal covers the main pedestrian routes in the inner city and paths leading to Metro and local public transport stops. The City Council will next consider the budget proposal at its meeting of 27 November 2019, continuing consideration started at the meeting of 13 November. The proposed funding would enable improvements in the conditions for walking on the busiest pedestrian routes.Read more:Winter cycling routes in the 2019-2020 season (on map)', \"The world is full of buzzing tech hubs and colossal metropolises, but none of them is the planet’s happiest capital with the best work-life balance. When you add on top of that the world’s leading startup event Slush and Maria 01 – soon to be the biggest startup campus in Europe – Helsinki competes totally in its own league.Helsinki is a frontline city pushing global change, and entrepreneurship is a powerful way to change the world and make an impact. Helsinki’s objective is to be Europe’s most captivating location for innovative startups and the most attractive knowledge hub for companies and individuals wanting to make world-changing business.One of the ways to accomplish this is the tight collaboration between the City of Helsinki and Slush. The value of Slush is considerable to Helsinki and entire Finland, and that is why the city makes increasing investments in the co-operation.“The global startup community's interest towards Helsinki grows continually. Slush and our expanding startup campus Maria 01 are important factors in this success, but one of our assets is also the quality of everyday life we have to offer. It’s easy to accomplish a great work-life balance in a city where residents for example spend an average of only 26 minutes commuting, which is significantly less than in the majority of business capitals in the world”, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Helsinki is bolstering its international reputation among talent. One of the barriers for Finnish growth companies is attracting talent. Helsinki wants to improve city’s image as a place to live.“Majority of foreign experts who have settled in Helsinki are satisfied with the quality of life here. We’ve noticed that when we do get the people companies are trying to recruit to experience Helsinki for themselves, their enthusiasm ignites and they are more likely to sign a contract”, says Laura Aalto, CEO of Helsinki Marketing.A new marketing campaign City as a Service (CaaS) was launched in September together with local companies in the technology sector. As part of the campaign, Helsinki has now invited 15 tech pros around the world to experience what true work-life balance can mean. The demo trip takes place during Slush week, on 19–22 November. Helsinki’s CaaS project has well-known partners: Supercell, Smartly, Slush, Relex, and MaaS Global (Whim).The new deeper cooperation between the City of Helsinki and Slush focuses on making Helsinki better known and on supporting the growth company field. This is strongly visible especially to the event’s international visitors.Slush and the City of Helsinki are also working together to make Helsinki the leading birthplace of companies that are solving the most urgent global problems of our time.“At Slush, we believe that entrepreneurship is one of the most effective ways to create change in the world. Entrepreneurs have always been problem-solvers. Today, the problems our world is facing are more complex and urgent than ever. Startups that have a product that solves a big problem as their core business will be among the fastest routes to solving the challenge at scale”, says Andreas Saari, the CEO of Slush.Slush’s and the City’s joint campaign “4 Reasons” brings up growth entrepreneurship as a way of solving significant problems in the world. Additionally, Helsinki has its own campaign theme in support of the message called “A worklife worth living”, which speaks of the City’s top-level quality of life and the work-life balance that is rooted in functionality.Helsinki is the main partner of Slush’s new Ready to Launch event, which focuses on product development. The Nordic Countries have for long lacked a visionary event of this type and Slush is now launching the new event in collaboration with the City. The event arranged at the Cable Factory on 20th of November is expected to attract around a thousand visitors.This year, it is also possible to take a look at Slush's offerings without an admission ticket. The semi-finals of the Slush100 Pitching Competition is for the first time arranged in a public location, in the middle of the Kamppi shopping centre on 20thof November. At the event, early-stage startups challenge each other in a pitching competition. Helsinki is a partner of the event.Startup campus Maria 01 is built at a former hospital complex in downtown Helsinki. Maria 01 is a home to over 130 start-ups and scale-ups, 12 venture capital funds, several ecosystem supporters, and over 1,100 members.At the moment Maria 01 drives an ambitious expansion to become Europe’s largest startup campus. The campus will expand from its current 10,000 sq m space to 70,000 sq m by 2026. The future campus will attract approximately 650 new operators and new jobs for at least 6,000 people.Maria 01 is owned by the owners of the Nordic’s biggest startup conference Slush, the City of Helsinki and Helsinki Enterprise Agency.TOP 4 reasons to do business in Helsinki:1.

The pursuit to provide a good life for its citizens has yielded good results. At Slush 2019, Helsinki takes on the hot topic of work-life balance.In recent years, the city of Helsinki has focused its resources on a specific goal: to create the best urban life for everyone through, for example, developing housing, infrastructure and transportation, as well as creating better jobs. Everything is based on functionality, equality and a sense of community – the very founding values of what is currently one of the fastest growing cities in Europe. Functionality requires innovation, a fact Helsinki has long appreciated. The city is relatively young, and was built literally from nothing. Unhindered by too much tradition, the city cherishes unbiased grassroots experimenting and new ideas by locals and officials alike. With a can-do attitude in its DNA, the city’s telling motto is: “One HEL of an Impact”.The good life in Helsinki is not just talk. Recent years have seen the city racking up outstanding results in global comparisons focused on the quality of life. To mention a few, it ranked #1 in work-life balance in a 40-city survey by the technology company Kisi in social cohesion in IESE Business School Cities in Motion Index, and in equal opportunity in a European-wide comparison conducted by Spotahome. Furthermore, Helsinki received 6th place in Monocle’s highly esteemed Quality of Life Index, which is no small achievement. Other areas of success in surveys include life-long learning, security and happiness.What is behind all the success? Helsinki’s Director of Economic Development, Marja-Leena Rinkineva, has an answer: “It’s a combination of many things that support each other. Besides concrete things like family-oriented social benefits, remote work opportunities and a first-rate transportation system, there’s equality, cohesion, mutual trust, work-life balance and low hierarchies. In short, it means we’re able to provide security and predictability that enable people to thrive and prosper.” According to Rinkineva, this is only the beginning: “There’s so much more to do. As a mother of three with a long career, I’m a living proof of that Helsinki redefines itself constantly through the actions of its people. It’s about small things in our daily lives we seek to improve. We feel that this humble attitude has served us well.”In the competition for attracting the best talent, the city of Helsinki draws from its strengths and tackles the problems of today’s working life by focusing on work-life balance. “Nurturing a healthy balance between work and leisure is essential to our values and we want to get that message across around the world”, explains Tommo Koivusalo from Helsinki’s NewCo startup services. To turn words into action, Helsinki has designed the City as a Service (CaaS) platform, a service bundle that states its mission is to motivate, guide and help international tech talent to feel at home in the city. As part of showcasing its first demo, Helsinki invited a number of tech pros from around the world for a visit. “We want to show that when everything works seamlessly, maintaining a work-life balance becomes so much easier”, Koivusalo says.In conjunction with the CaaS project, Helsinki continues its partnership with Slush by launching a new campaign at the event that aims to jump-start discussions among the tech elite and challenge their conceptions of work-related values. To encourage reflection, Helsinki brings artful mirror installations to the centre of the event. On these mirrors, change provoking questions about working life are presented in ways that invite the Slush generation to stop and think about their work-life balance. The same kind of questions are placed on ads all over the city for the duration of Slush. The slogan is “Worklife worth living”.“First, you’ve got to make people rethink their values and the way they work. Only from recognising the problem can a change be brought about and a healthy and a productive working life be made possible. At the end, it’s not only about the quantity but more and more about the quality of your work”, Koivusalo sums up the idea. Work-life balance is a soft metric. It doesn’t really arouse images of hard-working go-getters – the likes of which we see in movies about Wall Street. Is Helsinki really encouraging people to forget their careers? Says Rinkineva: “We want to be really clear on this. Helsinki as a city is very pro entrepreneurship. The next leap in productivity comes from innovations. The innovations are brought about in inspiring environments where creative minds can flourish. Our strategy is proving to be successful. A healthy work-life balance means business. And, make no mistake, I mean serious business.”More informationYouTube: A Worklife Worth LivingHelsinki\\xa0– City as a Servise (CaaS)Slush 2019: November 21–22, HelsinkiHelsinki, the home city of Slush, is the best place in the world to strike a balance between work and time off', 'The Metro runs two hours later than usual and many bus routes have additional services.During the pre-Christmas party season 15 November to 15 December, there are more passengers than usual on Friday and Saturday nights.

How are the event organisers supported? Helsinki wants to be a functional platform and facilitator for diverse and original urban culture. The new Helsinki Road Map for Events and the associated concrete action plan captures the role, goals and development to a level, which supports the successful implementation of the City Strategy.In the Helsinki City Strategy, the so-called eventness is an essential theme in the furthering of vitality and wellbeing, which has been developed with visible results for long. The City is a trustworthy stage for major events and one of the most popular conference destinations in Northern Europe. Of the several urban events that have been developed in Helsinki, many have been picked up around the world.The guidelines of the Road Map for Events were established to ensure that organising events in Helsinki is even easier in the future. There has to be a sufficient number of functional event locations in different parts of the City and sorting out the permits with the City must be uncomplicated.“The events hold a significant role in building up Helsinki’s agreeability, vitality and attractiveness. The local perspective is strongly visible in the City’s eventness and this is something that the City wants to strengthen in the future as well. At its best, the urban environment is a home to a diverse range of players, both in the large and in the small scale. In the eventness, Helsinki is not only a producer, but a partner and a platform as well. In the future, we want to be even better in all of these roles\", notes Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The Helsinki Road Map for Events has three main objectives:1. The events support and realise the City Strategy’s goals of an international, lively and fascinating City of events in the best possible way.2. The development of the events is based on responsibility.3. The eventness is functional.Helsinki wants to offer the best possible circumstances for urban good life. Urban culture is one essential enabler of good life. It extends Helsinki’s originality and attractiveness, increases the cultural understanding and reduces differentiation.Helsinki is committed to responsibility in all of its operations and it is also at the core of the event development. In the Road Map for Events, responsibility is analysed from three perspectives: through environmental responsibility, social responsibility and financial responsibility.A functional event environment that is safe for all is Helsinki’s strength and, at the same time, a prerequisite for the development of the event ecosystem. The City wants to be an even better partner for event players.“We aim to streamline and systematise the co-operation with event organisers and improve the services aimed at them. In order to achieve this, we must also develop the City’s internal co-ordination and communications”, says Project Manager Päivi Munther, who is in charge of the development of the eventness.Due to the urbanisation, the international competition between cities is constantly increasing. Events are used as a way of developing the City’s reputation and brand and developing an attractive local culture. Events hold an increasingly important role in tourism as well, but here, the mega-events are being ousted by local, original events.“We want to expand the international profile and attractiveness of the essential Helsinki events in collaboration with event organisers and actively support the creation of new events. The events also offer experimentation platforms for different kinds of innovations, which are developed in co-operation with companies and event visitors”, tells Head of Marketing Sanna Forsström.The Event Road Map was published to the players in the sector at Helsinki’s event seminar on 13 November 2019. In Helsinki, the implementation of the Road Map for Events and the development of eventness is co-ordinated by the Helsinki City Executive Office Communications.The Road Map for Events covers a period of several years. The previous Road Map for Events was published in 2010. The Road Map was established using a vision, which was compiled from 43 interviews, 4 rounds of workshops with around 100 persons and 104 answers to an online survey. The interviews and workshops included participants from within the City organisation, event organisers and public authorities. The online survey was aimed at event organisers.More information (soon also in English)', 'This year, it is the 71st time for Aleksanterinkatu to be decorated in festive lights.

The amount of pram parking space will also be increased in connection with this change.When services intended for families with children are located close to each other, the library staff and the personnel at Playground Loru will be better able to work together. The balcony on the third floor is also a warmer and cosier space for the littlest customers at Oodi than the first floor.Customer feedback was taken into consideration when making this change by holding two meetings and creating an online survey in the autumn of 2019. All of the 300 responses to the survey were reviewed carefully and used as a basis for improvements to services for those visiting Oodi with prams.The amount of pram parking space will the doubled once the space is moved to the third floor, because people felt that the current space was too small. New pram parking areas will be opened in the southern and northern ends of the first floor. Each parking area will be designated by rugs and a sign that reads P. All pram parking areas will be accompanied by seating for dressing children.Towards the end of the year, the pram parking areas on the first floor will be equipped with stands that can be used to secure the prams using customers’ own locks. Architects will be designing lockable lockers that can be operated with a library card, near the pram parking areas on the first floor. The lockers can be used to store small bags or children’s winter clothes, for example. The lockers will be installed in Oodi in the spring of 2020.Approximately 9,000 people visit Oodi daily. This number includes seniors, school children, students and tourists, to name a few. There may be hundreds of children of different ages in Oodi at any given time, for example.

The City of Helsinki Urban Environment Committee approved the City’s workout stairs guideline and workout stairs programme on 3 September 2019. The guideline determines the organization of Helsinki workout stairs services and the quality criteria of the services. The programme, drawn up for 2020–2030, determines guidelines for the further development of the workout stairs network.“Stair running has become an increasingly popular workout and sport. Judging by resident feedback, there is great demand for workout stairs,” says planning expert Mikko Malmström.\\xa0\\xa0Today Helsinki has workout stairs at three sites: on the Malminkartanonhuippu artificial hill in Malminkartano, in Paloheinä and in Herttoniemi. The Paloheinä workout stairs are in good condition. The Malminkartano and Herttoniemi workout stairs will be renovated.\\xa0According to the Helsinki workout stairs programme, nine new stairs sites will be built in the city in the next few years. The new sites are as follows: Alakivenpuisto, the Alppikylänhuippu artificial hill, Ilomäenpuisto, Lauttasaari sports park, Mäntymäki, Pihlajisto, Suutarila, the Talinhuippu artificial hill, and either Vanttikallio or the Vuosaarenhuippu artificial hill in Vuosaari. The site in Vuosaari will be decided as stairs construction is scheduled. All sites should be easily accessible and in the vicinity of sports and recreational trails.\\xa0The workout stairs construction schedule will be determined in more detail as the City Council makes decisions on the 2020 budget. As a result of budget negotiations, the City Board has decided to propose to the City Council that the construction of nine new workout stairs sites of the workout stairs programme and the renovation of two existing sites be carried out on an accelerated schedule. According to the proposal, site implementation would be commenced as early as in 2020.\\xa0Read more:\\xa0', \"The City Council will discuss the budget for next year and the financial plan for the years 2020–2022 on Wednesday, 27 November.

Next year,\\nHelsinki’s investment level exceeds one billion euros, a first in the history\\nof the City. The\\nhigh investment level has been made possible by the responsible and persevering\\nmanagement of the City economy. The forthcoming economic insecurity\\nnecessitates that Helsinki provides for the sustainability of the growth in the\\nfuture as well.\\xa0 Helsinki\\nassumes its responsibility for balancing the public economy and works to\\nimprove the City’s total productivity, while, at the same time, the City’s\\nexpenditure is moderately increased especially in the services where the\\npopulation growth increases the costs most directly. The needs of the growing City is acknowledged in the total dimensions of the operating expenses as well. The total expenditure level in the 2020 budget is about 122 million euros higher than the current year. In 2020, the increase in the operating expenses on the entire City level is around 3 percent from 2019.The overall framework for the operational economy in the City Strategy is jointly defined by the population growth, changes in the level of costs and the 0.5 percent productivity goal. When the budget framework was drafted in spring, the estimated population growth and changes level of costs would have allowed an expenditure growth of 3.47 percent from 2019. All division committee budget proposals were drafted a little above the spring city-level budget framework of 3.47 percent. Based on the proposals of the committees, the combined growth on the city level would be 4.32 percent.The current estimates concerning both the level of costs and the population growth development are lower than in the spring estimates, which means that the strategy-based expenditure growth according to the most recent estimates is 3.03 percent from 2019. The lowered estimates concerning the level of costs and the population growth lower the pressures on the expenditure of the divisions as well.In the 2020 budget, the external operating expenses are 4.598 billion euros. The growth percentages of the budget vary between the divisions within the 3.03-percent limit for the City’s total expenditure.\\nIn the allocation of appropriations, special attention has been paid, in accordance with the City Strategy, to services where the population growth adds to the costs most directly, as well as to the unit cost development at the divisions. The two-year growth in the level of appropriations has also been observed in the allocations (from the 2018 financial statements to the 2020 budget per division). The expenditure growth per division is presented in the table: The operational economy part, income and expenditure per division., (only in Finnish). When it comes to the Urban Environment Division's budget item for buildings and the culture and leisure services, the change in the appropriations for 2020 must be viewed on the operating margin-level.According to the estimate, the population growth is the highest in elderly population groups and this has been taken into account by directing investments towards the budget proposal of the Social services and health care division. The introduction of the new patient data system Apotti in the upcoming year is going to reshape the courses of action and improve the patient safety, but it will also increase the expenditure.\\xa0\\xa0Investments are made to further the utilisation of digitalisation and information technology and additional resources are also directed, e.g., towards the improvement of the service standard in the rescue operations. At the City Executive Office’s new Strategy Department, a digitalisation unit will be established to focus on the comprehensive development of digitalisation on the City level. In its operations, Helsinki accentuates ecological values and emphasises local actions in the implementation of global responsibility. Searching for ecological solutions in new construction, improving the energy efficiency in buildings and implementing emissions reductions by means of urban planning and traffic solutions are Helsinki’s principles of responsible development. In 2020, Helsinki launches the international Helsinki Energy Challenge to find heating solutions that can replace burning coal with as little use of biomass as possible.No changes are proposed to Helsinki’s local tax rate for 2020, as the budget proposal is based on a local tax rate of 18.0 percent. The estimated tax revenue for the upcoming year is 2.74 billion euros. This constitutes a 5.4 per cent improvement to the estimate for the current year. However, the 2019 and 2020 increase in the local tax revenue is affected by the tax administration's tax deduction card reform and the reporting problems of the Incomes Register, which move renderings of accounts of taxes from 2019 to 2020. Due to this, the growth percentage for the tax revenue in 2020 frames the accrual of tax revenue in a more positive light than what it is in reality. The increase of the local tax from 2018 to 2020 is estimated at 6.2 percent in total, which better describes the real growth pace of the tax base.The estimated corporate income tax revenue is 600 million euros, or 1.7 percent more than the 2019 estimate. The estimated real estate tax revenue is 283 million euros and the proposed real estate tax rates in Helsinki are kept at the 2019 level. - The estimate for the local tax and corporate income tax revenues includes significant uncertainty factors for the next year and in the long-term for the upcoming years as well. The events in the global economy and the general decline in the market conditions affect Helsinki’s economic outlook as well. The economy of the growing City is already being put to the test. A healthy economy is a condition of life for sustainable growth and securing sustainable growth is the City’s most important task, stresses Jan Vapaavuori.In 2020, the central government transfers for basic public services increase to 280 million euros. A significant part of the increase of around 80 million euros in the central government transfers compensates either the decrease in the tax revenue or the increase that has already occurred in the costs based on the central government transfers. Preliminary estimates show that the equalisation of the tax revenue base, which is included in Helsinki’s income from central government transfers, is –376 million euros in 2020. The increase in the tax-based equalisations paid by the Helsinki has been steep in 2017, Helsinki paid -289 million euros in tax-based equalisations. – The increase in the tax-based equalisations paid by the City of Helsinki shows that an attractive and successful capital is widely beneficial to the entire country. The capital’s investments in sustainable growth work as resuscitation for a favourable development in the entire country in a situation where private investments are expected to decrease. Helsinki’s responsibility for the entire Finland grows and I hope that it adds to the understanding that the best possible operating conditions for the capital to do well in the international competition is an advantage to the entire Finland, says Vapaavuori. According to the City Strategy, investments are kept at a level that can be funded without adding to the per capita indebtedness. The estimate for the loan stock at the end of 2020 is 1,010 million euros, or 1,530 euros per capita.\\xa0\\nHelsinki’s investment level will exceed one billion euros in 2020. The growth in the investment expenditure is 31,3 percent compared to 2019. Municipally owned company Helsinki City Transport’s investments are 217 million euros and the biggest single investment project is the construction and planning of the infrastructure for the Jokeri light rail line.\\nIn the investment programme, the focus is put on maintenance of built assets, reaching the housing production goals and investments required by business life, as well as on the development of the service network. In repair construction, emphasis is laid especially on ensuring safety and healthiness in schools and day-care centres. – In\\naddition to repair construction and investments, beating the challenges related\\nto the quality of indoor air calls for a new kind of mind-set with an\\nincreasingly comprehensive approach. Rectifying the City’s premises process is\\na central priority for the City. In support of this task, the City is currently\\nworking on a real estate strategy, the goal of which is to create an inclusive\\njoint vision of the objectives for the City’s real estate maintenance and real\\nestate ownership, emphasises Vapaavuori.The City’s growth is also visible in the increasing investments to reach the City’s housing production goal. In 2018, there were 4,843 housing units completed in Helsinki and the estimated number of completed housing units for 2019 is 6,500. In 2020, the estimated number of completed housing units is 6,800, and in 2021 it is as high as 7,000. The areas of focus in the housing construction are in Kalasatama and Länsisatama. In 2020, the City continues to implement the long-term wages and salaries development plan, which is based on an analysis of the essential development needs connected to the wages and salaries of the personnel and personnel groups as well as on the employer's needs in ensuring the availability of skilful labour. In the 2020 budget, a total of 5 million euros have been reserved for the implementation of the wages and salaries development plan. Personnel organisations have been consulted in the preparation of the wages and salaries development plan.During the upcoming year, the wages and salaries development plan will put special focus on the situation at the health centre to attract skilful labour especially by developing the wages and salaries of health centre physicians, public health nurses and registered nurses and practical nurses. The performance bonus system used by the City will also be reworked during 2020 and increased rewarding for a good work performance is encouraged.Processing\\nschedule for the budget proposal:3 October, The Mayor's Budget Proposal is published  7 October and 28 October, The City Board processes the budget proposal  13 November and 27 November, The City Council processes the budget proposal.  13 November, The City Council decides on the local tax rate and real estate tax rates.The Mayor's 2020 Budget Proposal (Finnish-Swedish)\", 'The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and Helsinki Central Library Oodi are introducing a new partnership for the spring 2020 season, when it will be possible to borrow season tickets to the orchestra’s concerts using a library card.

While the growth has been fuelled primarily by Central Library Oodi, the attractiveness of local libraries has been noted all over Helsinki.In 2019, Helsinki’s public libraries have recorded 46% more visits than during the same period last year. By the end of September, Helsinki City Library’s locations had been visited a total of 6.8 million times. The main reason for the increase in visits is the popularity of Central Library Oodi, which opened in December 2018: Oodi is by far the most popular library with nearly 2.5 million visits. However, the library boom has been felt in other parts of Helsinki as well. The next most popular libraries this year have been Kallio Library (324,775 visits) and Itäkeskus Library (307,413 visits).Laajasalo and Maunula recorded the highest increases Among the libraries that have experienced a notable increase in visits are Laajasalo and Maunula, which recently moved to new facilities. Laajasalo Library has recorded a 37% increase in the number of visits compared to last year, while Maunula Library has recorded an increase of 13%. “Oodi’s first year of operation has made libraries more visible than ever in Helsinki and throughout Finland,” states City of Helsinki’s Director of Library Services Katri Vänttinen. “It has been great to see how much people love their local libraries, use their services and discuss the tasks of libraries in a critical manner. Oodi, too, has established itself as many people’s local library, and its usage rates are by far the highest in regard to both visits and loans. I hope that people across Helsinki will continue to actively contribute to the development of library services by giving us feedback and participating in events held at libraries, for example.”37,000 new library cards and 3.9 million loans In addition to the number of visits, the number of loans and the number of new library cards issued have also increased. By the end of September, Helsinki City Library had issued 37,095 new library cards, of which over 15,000 were made at Oodi. The number of new library cards issued has grown by 54% compared to the same period last year.The number of loans has grown by 6% compared to last year, with library visitors recording a total of 3.9 million loans.Monday is the busiest day at libraries In Helsinki, the most popular day to visit the library is Monday. Based on the number of visits, it is the busiest day at all other public libraries except Oodi, where the most popular days are Saturday and Thursday.At Oodi, the number of visits recorded exceeded 2.7 million in October. The combined number of visits recorded by Helsinki’s libraries is expected to exceed 9 million this year, with Oodi’s share expected to be over 3 million.Helsinki City Library’s service network includes 37 public libraries, 2 mobile libraries and the services of the Home and Service Library for those who cannot reach a library by their own means.Library visits recorded at the locations of Helsinki City Library (January–September) 2018: 4,687,058 visits 2019: 6,821,525 visits change 2018/2019: +46%Top 3 libraries in January–September 2019 Oodi 2,466,338 visits Kallio 324,775 visits Itäkeskus 307,413 visitsNew library cards 2018: 24,053 new library cards 2019: 37,095 new library cards (of which 15,621 were issued at Oodi) change 2018/2019: +54%First loans (not counting renewals) 2018: 3,707,591 loans 2019: 3,944,193 loans change 2018/2019: +6%Photo: Maunula Library by Maarit Hohteri', 'The renovation of the Hämeentie street area begun in March 2019 has progressed well considering the demanding conditions of the work.\\xa0\\xa0Water pipe replacement is 74-percent complete, and 77 percent of soil excavation and 69 percent of rock excavation have been completed.

The number of registered participants was 69,284. The number of voters was 49,705. The voter turnout reached almost eight percent. This was the biggest electronic voting event arranged by the public sector in Finland.Of the 296 plans that were put up for vote, 44 plans were voted to the implementation phase. The plans that went through in the OmaStadi voting 2019 can be viewed here. The plans with the most votes according to area: Southern: Green City 57,000 euros, votes 2052.Eastern: More cleanliness to eastern Helsinki 113,000 euros, votes 1755.Southeastern: Report on the renovation of Aino Ackté’s villa 100,000 euros, votes 2727.Central: Artificial grass pitch on the field next to Arabian peruskoulu 435,000 euros, votes 2870.Northeastern: Services in support of mobility and well-being for the elderly to northeastern Helsinki 50,000 euros, votes 1182.Western: Urban fireplaces 120,000 euros, votes 1272.Northern: Summer jobs and help for summer tasks 83,000 euros, votes 833.Entire City: More trees to Helsinki 35,000 euros, votes 9234.“Voting on concrete local projects has brought a new sense of participation to tens of thousands of Helsinkians. Many of the propositions voted for have been about furthering the Most Functional City in the World in practical terms. Thanks to the citizens, we are many steps closer to our strategic goals”, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.In Helsinki, the OmaStadi voter turnout was almost eight percent. The voter turnout for the first round of OmaStadi was favourable in international comparison. In other countries, the voter turnout for participatory budgeting even after many rounds has been around 2–10 percent.OmaStadi got the people of Helsinki to discuss the affairs in areas together”OmaStadi brought people together and worked as an inspiration to discuss the affairs of the neighbourhoods, and the development of them, in an entirely new way. This has not happened before at the same time on the city level. The seven borough liaisons of the City have done a great job in communicating the message of OmaStadi in their areas and encouraged citizens to make their own proposals and vote”, says Omastadi Development Manager Kirsi Verkka.The people of Helsinki were committed developers during the first year of participatory budgeting. The total number of proposals submitted was 1,273, of which 839 were accepted. The proposals were worked into 296 plans that were put up for vote. The voting result was determined according to how many votes each proposal got and which plans could be included in the budget for the area. The first plan chosen for implementation was the one that received the most votes in the area. After that, the focus was laid on the plan with the second most votes and whether it could be included in the remaining budget for the area. If the plan with the second most votes exceeded the remaining appropriation, then the focus was shifted to the plan with the third most votes. If it could be included in the remaining appropriation, then it was chosen for implementation. If not, then the next one was considered. This method made it possible for smaller plans with less votes to advance to the implementation phase.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori confirms the voting result by the end of this year. The preparation of the implementation of the plans starts next year. In the Omastadi.hel.fi service, it is possible to follow the preparation and advancements of the implementation of the plans during 2020.The OmaStadi model for participatory budgeting has come to stay. Next year, Helsinki once again invites the citizens to make proposals into OmaStadi.Read more:OmaStadi 2019 voting resultsHow the voting result is determinedOmastadi.hel.fi', 'What is phenomenon-based learning in practice at the schools of Helsinki? Helsinki Education Week provides a good opportunity to find that out, as the schools invite guests to have a look at their everyday operations.For example, visitors at Vesala Comprehensive School can look into workshops led by the pupils, the themes of which cover topics such as robotics, animal rights and research work.“The contents of the workshops are based on the pupils’ own thoughts and interests. The contents were created in collaboration,” says teacher Panu Keskinen.The school has a long history of maintaining a culture in which the pupils get to explore and work on things themselves. The school has had a designated plant and animal room for a long time, and several teachers are interested in robotics, for example.Keskinen says that when pupils get to think about perspectives and take their time to look into each theme discussed, their learning deepens as well.“The most enthusiastic pupils even work on things on their free time.”The pupils’ knowledge and skills are built together, and the teacher acts as an instructor. Keskinen finds it essential that the pupils’ suggestions and questions are not rejected immediately. It is equally important to discuss themes through perspectives that motivate everyone to take part. The teacher plays an important role in creating a positive atmosphere.Studying cross-subject topics is key in phenomenon-based learning. The studies focus on real-world phenomena, and the pupils’ understanding of the topics is built together. The schools allocate time for phenomenon-based learning as an important supplement to the other forms of learning taking place.Heidi Halkilahti laments that discussions regarding phenomenon-based learning are sometimes sidetracked. She works as a project planner in a phenomenon-based learning modelling project at the City of Helsinki.Phenomenon-based learning has sometimes been seen as busywork that is detached from the goals of the curriculum and leaves the pupils to manage on their own.“The teachers are bound by a curriculum that also obligates them to take a learner-oriented, communal and multidisciplinary approach. This is not just busywork by any means, but highly goal-oriented, long-term and versatile work with the learners.”Halkilahti is a teacher herself. To her, the greatest significance of phenomenon-based learning lies in the value of each pupil: the goal is for each and every young person to find the joy of learning and interest in the world around them. This supports them and helps them develop into enthusiastic learners, as well as active and co-operative citizens.Schools now face a major task in getting pupils to stop, think and focus – in order words, detach themselves from a sense of hurry.“Schools used to lack a multifaceted, learner-oriented and long-term process in which the pupils themselves get to carry out things, ask questions, think about things and explore. Not everything is considered a viable study topic, as the activities must always have a goal.”Halkilahti emphasises that phenomenon-based learning steers learners towards problem-solving, functionality, a multidisciplinary approach and independent responsibility.No one knows what kind of a skill set will be required from people in the future. Thus, today’s learners must learn how to update their knowledge and skills while also discussing things, being critical where necessary and resolving matters together.“Practising these multifaceted skills must be included in the school week from the start in order for learners to gradually learn to take responsibility for their own actions and learning,” Halkilahti notes.Helsinki Education Week is full of events that enable participants to look into new ways of learning.Teacher Panu Keskinen aims to attract visitors to Vesala by boasting that they will get an opportunity to meet the best learners in the universe.After Vesala, visitors can move on to another school, such as Hiidenkivi Comprehensive School in Tapanila. Phenomenon-based learning is emphasised at Hiidenkivi as well, and visitors will have an opportunity to see how the school applies group pedagogy.Teacher Katariina Räkköläinen says that the pupils of Hiidenkivi all sit in four-person groups. The teacher selects the pupils’ table groups, and the pupils are in the same group for around ten weeks. After that, new groups are formed.The pupils’ roles change as well. They take turns acting as chairpersons, bookkeepers, organisers, environmental managers, etc. The groups also take various discussion and co-operation exercises.During Helsinki Education Week, Hiidenkivi Comprehensive School will offer presentations open to all visitors, as well as designated presentations for pedagogues.Helsinki Education Week', 'People have always been fascinated by scary places, ghost stories, mysteries and the dark side of history.

The artwork tells in an ingenious way of the birth of coffee.\\xa0\\n\\n  The artwork consists of four elements, it is about 11 meter long (36´) and reaches up to 3 meters height (10´).\\n  \\nAccording to the artist, the basic idea of the work is the discussion that emerges when people meet at a coffee table. The topics might be many, but the procedure is almost ceremonial. The piece reflects both this moment and the process that has preceded it, and tells about the history of Vuosaari.\\xa0The history of the Kahvikortteli (The Coffee Block) started when the well-known Paulig roosting company moved to the site in 1967. The activity ended when the city started the housing building project about 10 years ago.\\xa0\"Even if I can’t claim that this is a western ”coffee – ceremony”, is has elements of certain solid constructions. I hope that this piece of art mediates this situation with both solid structures and free and lively discussion.\"Antti Immonen (b. 1973), uses in his art a playful way of testing and variations that has room for coincidents. The completed artwork is often a still of a continuous ”build and tear down” – play.\\xa0Read more:\\nHam Helsinki Art Museum\\n\\n', 'The City of Helsinki’s cooperation with Harvard University and Bloomberg Philanthropies emphasised the importance of meeting people in person and promoting more agile operating cultures. A multi-disciplinary group tackled the root causes of the lack of mobility among the elderly.How can we find tangible solutions to modern, complex issues, such as increasing inequality, climate change and immobility? How should we face a challenge that cannot be solved by just an individual or their actions? How could we examine the root causes of the problems instead of only treating the symptoms? How can we solve one of the key well-being challenges of our time, immobility?The innovation programme by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University offers tangible tools for solving complex challenges and testing promising new ideas. Helsinki was the only European city to participate in the programme, which was implemented for the first time this year.The City of Helsinki chose the promotion of everyday mobility in the lives of the elderly as the theme for the programme. The reasoning is solid: increasing mobility is one of the City’s main objectives for this strategy season. Of the European countries, Finland’s population is aging most rapidly, and Helsinki is no exception to the rest of the country. According to estimates, the number of people over the age of 65 in Helsinki will increase from 108,000 to 170,000 by 2050. Mobility is important to people of all ages, but with age, its significance as a source of functional day-to-day life and independent living increases. Currently, only a few percent of people exercise sufficiently to maintain their health.A team of eleven employees from different City divisions was appointed to the innovation programme. The team consisted of employees who meet and exercise with the elderly, who perform strategic development tasks and who are responsible for digital services, land use planning and home care for the elderly, or who are responsible for the daily accessibility of culture and leisure time services.The team was led by service designer Ruben Ocampo, commissioned by Bloomberg Philanthropies, who specialises in steering urban planning work in the direction of user orientation.“I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Helsinki team. Something that really stuck with me was how vested all the team members are in the problem, which was manifested in how engaged they were in learning the methodology that we introduced, the high degree of care they showed in all their interactions with senior citizens, and their commitment to create real, sustainable solutions.The Helsinki team also made me feel incredibly at home! With each interaction we got to know each other more and more, and my last visit to the city had the taste of a bittersweet goodbye. I have continued to follow their progress on this project after the program wrapped up, and I look forward to not only seeing their solutions come to life, but also to staying in touch with the team members,” Ruben Ocampo says.Social Advisor Tuula Sillanpää from Kustaankartano Comprehensive Service Centre also enjoyed working with the multidisciplinary team.“In hindsight, I can say that a discussion as rich as this on increasing the mobility of the elderly could not have been possible without such a multidisciplinary team. What I found excellent about this programme was that the different divisions worked together,” she says.The programme was not created out of thin air. Each team member had relevant professional skills or experience from personal life. Helsinki already boasts many services, circumstances and projects that promote mobility among the elderly. Only the amount of research data and number of reports and reviews tops the former.The precise definition of the problem and gaining an understanding of the root causes took time. It is one thing to talk about increasing the number of times someone exercises and quite another to promote everyday mobility.“For the elderly, exercise is like medicine, this is something everyone who works with the elderly already knows. During this innovation programme I learned that mobility is not only about exercise or sports. For some, merely leaving the house can be considered a small victory. The elderly residents of Helsinki have a wealth of wisdom and resources that can be utilised in renewing and developing services,” says Head of Home Care Suvi Kan from the Social Services and Health Care Division.The training programme also strove to strengthen competence in terms of service development principles and methods within the City organisation. The objective was to utilise the lessons learned from the training programme in development across organisational boundaries as widely as possible.“Genuine human-oriented development to create new service concept ideas together with City operators and external operators requires time and effort. The process calls for empathy, curiosity, tenacity and the ability to live with incompleteness. These skills, and foremost the right attitude, can only be learned by doing and experiencing,” says Development Consultant Meri Virta from the City Executive Office.The team learned by completing exercises. In the span of nine months, the team members met with more than one hundred elderly people in the course of interviews and testing sessions in shopping centres, health stations, service centres, libraries and adult education centres. The purpose of these exercises was to ensure that any issues were understood thoroughly and that the experiences of elderly people are heard before making any proposals.  The observations of the team show that the life situations, resources, wishes and needs of the elderly are pointedly individual. Aging is related to many changes that can have comprehensive effects – this goes for mobility, too. These changes include retirement or the death of a spouse, falling ill, diminishing physical ability to function and reduced income.\\xa0The interviews showed that identifying these changes is important and providing the right kind of support in these trying times requires sensitivity. Activity in men, for example, is more related to their physical condition, and when the physical condition deteriorates, social interaction is also reduced dramatically. The relationship to digital services depends on the skills of the individual, but more importantly, on the support network that enables access to the digital world. You should always be careful when making assumptions: an 80-year-old may be more active on social media than a 40-year-old.The interviews highlighted the power of internal motivation and experiences of relevance. The will to engage in activities that are significant to the person themselves may help people overcome obstacles, such as challenges posed by diminishing physical functional capacity and condition. Local services support leading an independent life, which is why the significance of local services and the communal spirit in the neighbourhood is emphasised. As the innovation programme progressed, the concept of activity expanded to mean all social activity, of which actual exercise services only play one part.“Older people, seniors, the elderly, oldsters, pensioners. There are many words to describe older people, and there must be at least as many experiences of being something other than what can be summed up in one word. Each elderly person is an individual with their own background and hopes for the future. Supporting lifelong functional ability as well as physical and psychological well-being is the most important thing we can do for each of our fellow human beings,” says Education Manager Satu Luomajoki from the adult education centre.The research problem took the following shape in the course of the work: How can we ensure that each old person finds it easy and pleasant to leave the house every day? How could the friends and family of an old person and the professionals working with the elderly support mobility through their speech and actions, while also considering each individual’s functional ability, motivation and interests?The team collected ideas to resolve identified issues for the elderly and the professionals that work with them. More than 800 ideas were generated. Two prototypes were tested based on the ideas.The first idea to be tested was the ‘mobility bonus card,’ which was created to map individual motivational factors. Feedback from the users indicated that services, such as free concert tickets and spending time with friends, were valued more than monetary rewards.The second idea to be tested was the ‘mobility service centre.’ The idea was born out of the realisation that information on exercise opportunities should be distributed among the people and be presented in an easily understood and attractive form. The team also discussed a service that would make is easier to leave the house in practice and overcome physical and other obstacles. The team decided to try hiring young people as mobility advisors, who could walk with the elderly and keep them company on the way to various activities. This activity is based on an existing Job´d operating model funded by the We Foundation. In the model, young people with an immigrant background help older people in their everyday chores.“It is important to hear what the elderly are saying, truly listen and understand what they want, instead of shrugging their opinions off. Many interviewees were very pleased to be asked. Even though the attitude of the old person is often a deciding factor, encouragement from those who work with the elderly is not without merit, because not everyone has their own support network. I also learned that it is easier for some to be out and about when they have a clear destination, such as visiting a shopping centre. It would be wonderful if every old person could have their ‘own’ Job’d support person whom they could be active with,” says Nursing Manager Pirjo Tyllillä from Kustaankartano Comprehensive Service Centre.The mobility service centre was tested in a genuine environment in July, in shopping centre Kaari in Kannelmäki. Shopping centres are everyday meeting places visited by both senior citizens and their loved ones. They provide a natural environment to reach people and meet each person with their individual needs. The service centre was designed by Harvard University postgraduate student Taylor Greenberg Goldy, who spent the summer taking a deep dive into the content of the innovation project in Helsinki.In Kaari, the service centre experiment gathered information on City services under one roof in the shopping centre. Visitors could find out more about the likes of City sports services, adult education centre classes, home care, social and health care services, and the offering of service centres. Visitors to the centre could measure their grip strength and discuss their mobility, experiences and hopes with City of Helsinki employees. Two mobility service providers from the shopping centre also participated. The purpose was to think of a neighbourhood as an area where all the services that promote and inspire mobility were packaged into a user-friendly package. The two-day test run of the mobility service centre was very educational. Nearly 50 older people and their loved ones visited the centre. Each visitor had their own unique story. These discussions led to the idea that elderly people could act as mobility advisors for each other, sort of ambassadors and contact people between the City and those older people with a high risk of becoming isolated.The idea that the service centre could also have some light activities in addition to serving up information on current services in the area was also floated. The team concluded that the service centre could be used as a place where you could sign up for events and review event attendance afterwards.The understanding of the principles that should be recognised in designing services accumulated during the programme was enriched as a result of the trial.“Customer-oriented development opens up the diversity of human life and the countless different challenges and opportunities that serving people presents. People are not a homogenous mass. Understanding individual needs and serving people with a personal touch creates an experience of a functional city,” says Chief Digital Officer Mikko Rusama from the City of Helsinki.The innovation programme may be very significant in terms of planning strategic programmes or measures.“The innovation programme showed us that before we start thinking about tangible measures, we must take the time to define our goals and understand the root causes. Without a shared understanding of the problem at hand, we risk implementing measures that treat the symptom instead of healing the patient. It was also delightful to understand that measures do not always have to be planned and prepared for years in advance at the office before having the courage to test and subject them to feedback from the people that the measures are for,” says Project Manager Minna Paajanen from Helsinki’s physical activity programme.The lessons learned from the innovation programme for the promotion of mobility amongst the elderly became part of the physical activity programme of the City of Helsinki. The programme contains nearly 60 measures. The conclusions and observations from the innovation programme have been advanced to processing within the City organisation.“Genuinely meeting and listening to people takes time, but also highlight many different viewpoints and individual needs, even quite small things, that could solve mobility challenges for individuals,” says Minna Ekman, sports planning officer at the City of Helsinki.Going forward, the most important measures are the ones that clarify marketing and communications directed at the elderly increase local cooperation between the public, private and third sector offer support for older people whose functional ability has diminished and create opportunities for volunteer work.“In the innovation programme, we learned that change is only affected by meeting people face to face. Starting from next year, we will focus our marketing efforts on areas that people would visit anyway – places like shopping centres, health stations and libraries. We also learned that many people would like to be of use, but need a little push. We will be making it easier to become a volunteer mobility advisor and increasing cooperation with companies and organisations. All reasons to be physically active are valuable. It is always a triumph when the front door opens, regardless of whether the senior is going to the grocery store, Nordic walking, a hockey game, a concert or the library,” says Executive Director of the Culture and Leisure Division Tommi Laitio.Further information:The physical activity programme of the City of Helsinki (in Finnish)The Harvard University and Bloomberg Philanthropies innovation programme team: Executive Director of the Culture and Leisure Division Tommi Laitio, Project Manager of Helsinki’s physical activity programme Minna Paajanen, Head of the Development Unit Reetta Sariola, Sports Planning Officer Minna Ekman, Social Advisor Tuula Sillanpää, Nursing Manager Pirjo Tyllilä, Head of Home Care Suvi Kan, Education Manager Satu Luomajoki, Head of Urban Planning Division Richard Manninen, Chief Digital Officer Mikko Rusama and Development Consultant Meri Virta.City Innovation Track is part of the leadership and management training for mayors provided by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University.

The signage is designed to guide visitors on the existing recreational routes. The signage will be installed in two phases: the first part for the park area north of Ring Road I in the spring of 2020, and the second part for the southern section of the park in the following year. A draft of the signage design is now on display (with text in Finnish) at kerrokantasi.hel.fi, the City of Helsinki online feedback channel, and feedback can be submitted until 17 November 2019.\\xa0The new signage for Central Park is produced in response to significant amounts of feedback from the public gathered in conjunction with natural area and landscape maintenance, as well as through other feedback channels. There is a pronounced need for new signage in Central Park, as the park’s extensive route network is supported by inadequate signs.\\xa0New signs and information panels to be installed in the park will allow visitors to plan their hiking, jogging, cycling and other recreational tours. The Central Park visitor centres and other key sites will be provided with information panels with maps. Key junctures will be provided with maps and signs. The main north-to-south route of Central Park, horse riding trails, illuminated recreational skiing tracks and a mountain bike trail will be marked with bands attached to posts or trees and lighting poles.\\xa0The extensive cycling and pedestrian route network of Central Park changes for winter months. Central Park is a popular cross-country skiing location, and the ski tracks are maintained. The new signage will separate plowed pedestrian and cycling routes from ski tracks. A new and much requested route to be marked with signs leads from Kuninkaantammi to Niskala and from Niskala to Torpparinmäki. This route is plowed in winter.\\xa0The ski track network is so extensive at places that cyclists and pedestrians are guided to nearby streets, so as to provide Central Park users with much requested plowed detours.\\xa0A mountain bike trail planned and tested together with bikers will be marked both on maps and in the terrain. The trail will be suitable for all levels of mountain bikers. The most difficult places to cross ditches and wet areas will be rendered easy to cross and safe. The mountain bike trail marked in the terrain reduces wear to the surrounding nature.\\xa0\\nThe signage plan is now a draft. The makers of the plan request all active Central Park users and occasional visitors to comment on the draft, to obtain extensive and constructive feedback.

The plan also includes a new main access route and the construction of underground parking and maintenance facilities. No buildings are planned for the Keskuspuisto side.According to plans, the shared hospital in Laakso will have hospital beds for 930 patients. In addition to this, the area will have outpatient clinic premises, which will be located in the buildings that remain in the area, as well as facilities for training and research.A total of approximately 120,000 floor square metres of new space could be built. If the new hospital is built in its entirety, it will be roughly four times the size of the New Children’s Hospital in Helsinki.A new main access route is planned for the customer and maintenance traffic via the underground tunnel starting at Auroranportti. Parking space for 550 cars has been designed in the underground rock facility. The current access routes will remain.The Laakso hospital area is located in an area with easy access. The area enjoys versatile transport connections.According to the vision for hospital areas in the Metropolitan area, psychiatric hospital treatment in the Metropolitan area and the services of the Helsinki City Hospital should be centralised to the Laakso hospital area.The shared hospital of the City of Helsinki and HUS offers new opportunities to provide customers and patients with comprehensive treatment that meets their versatile needs. The shared hospital would employ an estimated 2,200 people.“We believe that the new hospital will be an attractive place to work for the professionals in the field. We are developing the Laakso shared hospital into an internationally significant hub of psychiatry, geriatrics and neurological rehabilitation competence that attracts the best in the field to Helsinki,” says HUS Psychiatry Project Manager, Chief Physician Kari Raaska, who is involved in planning the new hospital. “We must build new facilities. We can no longer use the old facilities or repair them to meet the standards of contemporary hospital treatment,” says Project Manager, Chief Nurse Administrator Tiina Pakasto from Helsinki City Hospital.Most of the new hospital facilities in the Laakso hospital area would be concentrated in the area between the old hospital area, Nordenskiöldinkatu and Reijolankatu. The intention is to preserve and protect the valuable hospital buildings in the northern section of the plot dating from the 1920s and 1930s, the former tuberculosis office from the 1950s and the surrounding park. These facilities will also be renovated for further use. The height of the new buildings on the Urheilukatu side would be close to the height of the roof of the hospital buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s. The height of the buildings could increase by a few levels towards the centre of the area.Main entrances would be located on the new plaza forming at the corner of Reijolankatu and Urheilukatu, in the drop-off area and on the Lääkärinkatu side.If the project continues on target schedule, construction could begin towards the end of 2021 at the earliest, and then continue in stages. New construction requires the demolition of some of the old buildings. The operation in these buildings would be moved to new premises prior to demolition.The town plan draft material of the Laakso shared hospital and the scale model of the area are on display 6–27 November 2019 in the participatory facility Brygga in Central Library Oodi. You can comment on the plans online until 27 November at kerrokantasi.hel.fi. The feedback will be utilised in further planning.The project will be presented in Central Library Oodi on Tuesday 19 November 2019. You can meet the designers in the lobby on the first floor 15.30–19.00. Presentations on the planning of the Laakso shared hospital will be held in Maijansali in Oodi at 15 and 18.The objective is to take the plan draft to the Urban Environment Committee in 2020.

The transition away from old buoys improves environmental friendliness, and the smart technology integrated into the new buoys increases safety in the fairway. The new buoys are part of Meritaito Ltd.’s InSea service concept. Safety in the busy fairway at Helsinki’s West Harbour will improve as the old buoys were replaced with buoys equipped with remote monitoring and control technology. This allows for data on the buoy, the navigational aid, any deviation from position and other faults to be available 24/7 in real time, and for the luminosity of the navigational aid to be adjusted to the prevailing weather conditions.Real-time situation reports on the location and status of buoys improves safety in the fairway, but also increases the predictability of maintenance and thereby also improves cost-efficiency.The connection of modern remote control and monitoring technology to navigational aids and the comprehensive maintenance service are both part of Meritaito’s InSea service agreement, which enables and accelerates the modernization of fairway navigational aids as a leasing service with a fixed monthly fee. The pricing model increases cost-efficiency as leasing fees are easily controlled and budgeted, and customer capital is not tied up in the fairway infrastructure.Read more:Port of Helsinki', 'In October, the people of Helsinki vote and choose the OmaStadi ideas that the City will implement.

The price cuts will apply to both single and season tickets. The prices of AB, BC and D tickets will not change.“This is the first time in our 10-year history we make such significant fare cuts. We will lower the fares for the longest journeys, as switching from driving to public transport for the longest journeys is most beneficial in terms of reducing emissions from traffic,” says HSL Executive Director Suvi Rihtniemi.The biggest benefit will be to those living in zones C and D, but also people living in zones A and B will benefit from the lower prices. For example, residents of Helsinki buy 27 per cent of ABC tickets and they are the third largest group of people buying ABCD tickets. The level of public transport service is poorer in zones C and D than closer to the center of Helsinki. In zones A and B, the level of public transport service is excellent.

Helsinki aims to accomplish carbon neutrality by year 2035, and hence it has launched 147 measures to reduce emissions and attain this goal. Thanks to the Climate Watch, anyone will be able to follow the progress of these measures and their impact on the amount of CO2 emissions in Helsinki. The Climate Watch is a service that comprises data on each measure in the emissions reduction programme and on their progress. Even the background assumptions and calculations that form the basis for the emissions assessments will in future be made public. The Climate Watch shows the order of magnitude of each measure and their effects on the attainment of the goal of carbon neutrality. In the service, you may also search and review Helsinki’s climate measures by theme or by body that is in charge.The political decision-makers may make use of the Climate Watch as they assess whether the emissions are being reduced as agreed. Thanks to the open data, the researchers will be able to assess the effects of the measures as well as the underlying assumptions and calculations. In future, also the city residents will be able to give feedback easily on the measures to reduce emissions and express how they would like to be involved in their implementation. The City of Helsinki aims at making it easy for the Helsinkians and those visiting the city to choose a climate-friendly lifestyle.Since 1990, Helsinki has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions already by 27 per cent. In its City Strategy, Helsinki has resolved to attain its 2035 carbon neutrality goal by a mix of measures out of which 80 per cent result in emissions reductions and 20 per cent consist of emission compensation. Thus, carbon neutrality will be attained, i.e. the net emissions should be zero with year 2035 as the period of review.“We prepared our Carbon-Neutral Helsinki 2035 Action Plan very transparently and would like to carry on this way also while reporting on its implementation and assessing the next steps.

According to the basic alternative of the latest population projection made by the Urban Studies and Statistics Unit at Helsinki City Executive Office, Helsinki’s population will be 820 000 in 2050. According to the “rapid growth” alternative of the projection, it would be no less than 880 000.The new population projection for Helsinki and the Helsinki Region extends to 2050 and the one for Helsinki’s districts to 2034. Both contain separate forecasts for the Swedish-language population.Annual population growth in Helsinki is expected at 6,700 on average well into the 2030s, then gradually turning slower with rising numbers of deaths – although not as much slower as in Statistics Finland’s new projection for the reason that, in the city’s projection, more dwellings are expected to be built than earlier in Helsinki.Over the next five years, the number of small children is forecast to decrease as birth rates fall. The number of 7-15 year olds, on the other hand, rises rapidly up until the mid 2020s, by even more than 1,500 a year.With the large post-war age groups getting older, the number of 75 year olds or older is starting to grow rapidly, by as much as 3,000 per annum in the early 2020s. The number of people of working age is forecast to continue to grow by 3,000-4,000 per annum up until the 2040s, but gradually only the over 50 year olds will be increasing in numbers. A large proportion of population growth will come from immigration.According to the forecast by district for Helsinki extending to 2034, population growth will be most substantial in the large housing developments currently under construction. The population is expected to grow by 13,000-16,000 each in the Kalasatama area, the Jätkäsaari-Hernesaari zone, Kruunuvuorenranta and the rest of Laajasalo, as well as in Pasila. In Vuosaari, too, the population is forecast to have grown by even 9,000 by the year 2034.Other important population growth areas include Lauttasaari, Kuninkaantammi, Malmin lentokenttä, Herttoniemen yritysalue, Oulunkylä, Etelä-Haaga, Myllypuro and Mellunmäki, where populations would grow by 3,000-5,500 each.Helsinki’s Swedish-language population of 36,500 people has grown by 1,335 in the 2010s, and is set to grow by, on average, 130 per annum, reaching 38,000 in 2034.Both small children and school children are expected to increase in numbers. The number of Swedish-language children is increased by the fact that children of families where the father is Swedish-speaking and the mother has some other mother tongue than Swedish are, today, predominantly registered as Swedish-speaking.The numbers of Swedish-language residents are forecast to grow in, especially, the Southern, Central and Southeast major districts. By 2034, the Swedish-speaking are set to increase by over 750 in Southern, by 600 in Central, and by 540 in Southeast major district. The housing developments in Jätkäsaari, Kalasatama and Laajasalo are, particularly, expected to attract Swedish-speaking people as well.Helsingin ja Helsingin seudun väestöennuste 2019–2050.

During the cruise season that ended on 22 October, a total of 603,500 cruise passengers arrived in Helsinki. This was 16 per cent more than the previous year. There were a total of 303 ship visits to Helsinki. This was the first time the number exceeded 300. This translates to a 6-percent growth from last year (2018:285).The largest percentages of cruise passengers came from Germany (32%), the United States (21%) and the United Kingdom (10%). The top three nationalities remained the same as the previous year, although the proportion of German visitors grew slightly. The proportions of other nationalities among visitors to Helsinki were all less than 5%.The popularity of Helsinki as a destination for international cruise ships has grown steadily. Helsinki is internationally attractive, and on top of that, everything works. The new LHD quay in Hernesaari, which serves large cruise ships, also proved to be functional. It was opened by the Port of Helsinki at the beginning of May.– We have had good feedback on wastewater reception and the general functionality of the quay from experienced captains as well as pilots, says Harbour Master Antti Pulkkinen from the Port of Helsinki.– All in all, this season was a success and we were pleased that no large cruise ship had to skip Helsinki due to bad weather in September or October.Read more:Port of Helsinki', 'Finland will switch to winter time on the night of Saturday/Sunday, 26/27 October.

Fallen leaves crushed under the tram wheels leave an oily residue on the surface of the tracks making tram wheels slip and lengthening the braking distance of trams.Drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are advised to take this into account when moving about the town. Do not cross the street at the last minute if you see a tram coming. Please also remind your children to be careful around the trams. \\xa0Trams can also jerk when starting from a stop and the slippery tracks can cause delays to trams.

Helsinki Biennial, which will be held on\\nVallisaari Island, will present around 35 international artists or groups of\\nartists from both Finland and around the world. “The location of Helsinki\\nBiennial is unique and we are delighted that some 80% of the works are\\ncompletely new,” Pirkko Siitari and Taru Tappola, the head curators, say.The first artists to be announced are Paweł Althamer, Katharina Grosse,\\nGustafsson&Haapoja, Hanna Tuulikki, IC-98, Marja Kanervo, Tadashi Kawamata,\\nAlicja Kwade, Laura Könönen, Tuomas A. Laitinen, Jaakko Niemelä, Mario Rizzi and Maaria Wirkkala. The BIOS Research Unit has also been invited to take part. Helsinki Biennial 2020 will take place on Vallisaari Island from 12 June to 27 September 2020. The artists have been invited to come to Vallisaari and create new site-specific and temporary artworks or to exhibit existing artworks that will engage in a dialogue with the island.The curators of Helsinki Biennial 2020 have given the event the subtitle: The Same Sea. “The ecological crisis means we are now on the cusp of enormous changes and this is defining our common future everywhere. The biennial’s subtitle, The Same Sea, refers to this situation, which concerns everyone but affects different places in different ways. Like the sea, it is a complex, inconstant entirety that bypasses all boundaries and appears different depending on the perspective,” the curators say. Vallisaari is the actual and conceptual starting point for the curation of Helsinki Biennial and has provided direction and inspiration for the work of the artists. The curators have explored the island with the artists, discussing it as an artistic context and seeking suitable locations for the artworks.“Vallisaari has an exceptional atmosphere. It\\'s like a zone touched by some unknown force. Yet, there is something there that reveals part of our collective memory, a part which we no longer have words to describe. The combination of its built environment and closed history and its untamed wildlife and environment on a small scale makes it a special place for an artist,” says Maaria Wirkkala.The artworks will be located outside along the cobbled path and inside historical buildings, gunpowder cellars and empty residential buildings. This will highlight unknown and abandoned places and give them new meanings.\\nIn addition to its geopolitical location, cultural history and nature, Vallisaari presents the artists with broader topical site-specific questions. These include time and change, the relationship between people and other species, and the micro and macro worlds that are beyond everyday observation. A few of the artists are working on subjects that originate from the daily life of Vallisaari’s former inhabitants and the island’s military history. According to the curators, some of the artworks deal not only with the local and global consequences of human activity but also with alternative visions of the future.In accordance with the Helsinki City Strategy, the biennial emphasises sustainability and responsibility, and these values are being respected as much as possible in the implementation of the event.“Making and presenting art on Vallisaari requires complex cooperation to take the delicate environment into account,” Siitari and Tappola say. \"The idea and site of each artwork have been evaluated from the point of view of nature conservation and preservation of historical buildings.”\\nThe delicate environment sets a strict framework for the art event, and HAM will collaborate with Metsähallitus, which manages Vallisaari, to safeguard it. An environmental programme will also be created for the biennial on the basis of the EcoCompass environmental management system.\\n“In September 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC published its second report, which proves the accelerating speed of climate change and the severity of its consequences. We believe that art has an important role in these circumstances. It has the unique ability to broaden our way of thinking, our understanding and our imagination,“ the curators say.Helsinki Biennial will make Helsinki even more attractive to residents and tourists from the perspective of art and culture by presenting works by leading international artists from Finland and around the world.“Helsinki’s bold and uncompromising investments in art also have a broader impact on the development of our home city, including the well-being of residents and the attractiveness of Helsinki as a tourist destination. Helsinki Biennial will further raise Helsinki’s status as an interesting city of culture and art,” says Mari\\nMännistö, Culture Director of the City of Helsinki.Helsinki Biennial is also a part of the City of Helsinki\\'s maritime strategy, which is turning the city\\'s archipelago into an attractive destination by making maritime services more accessible to all. The art event is a new reason to explore the city\\'s archipelago.\\xa0In collaboration with Metsähallitus, Helsinki Biennial will transform Vallisaari into a treasure island of art – a truly unique attraction.\\xa0Helsinki Biennial is an\\ninternational contemporary art event that takes place every two years.

The conference, held at Musiikkitalo in Helsinki on 9–10 October, was part of the official programme of Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and its theme was particularly topical: it is cities that serve as the stage for nearly all contemporary phenomena such as immigration, accelerating inequality and climate change. As cities grow quickly, it is important to find solutions to promote the well-being of both people and the climate. Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori opened the conference with a speech highlighting the significance of a long-term attitude towards the challenges cities face. Vapaavuori’s opening address was followed by a three-person panel discussion, where the former chair of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme Joan\\nClos stressed the immense speed of urbanisation. It is estimated that the urban population of the world will double by 2050. Throughout history, cities have been hubs for wealth, jobs and human capital, which is why the challenges of cities keep increasing in step with population growth. As challenges become more difficult at an increasing speed, we must come to a social contract that everyone can accept.Deputy Mayor Maria Vassilakou from Vienna continued by explaining how Vienna had succeeded in staying at the top of the list of the most liveable cities in the world for the past ten years. Comprehensive and affordable public transport, developing the city in a more child-friendly direction, comprehensive public housing production throughout the city and the construction of large green areas make Vienna a top class city to live in. This creates spaces where people naturally slow down their pace. The third participant in the panel was Marko Peterlin, director of the IPop research institute. He shared experiences from Ljubljana, which is dominated by vehicles and where traffic generates massive amounts of emissions resulting in high costs. Peterlin emphasised three points in his speech: instead of efficiency, we should be talking about a good day-to-day life private operators can help build networks to resolve social issues and we should always look beyond early adopters when designing solutions. Themes of the talks in the afternoon included data democracy, truly equal urban and social politics, and means of developing better cities. The first speaker of the afternoon, Chief Technology and Digital Innovation Officer at Barcelona City Council Francesca Bria stressed the significance of a human-centric data society. Europe must be careful not to drift into a North American system of data giants, where data is owned by the mighty and few. On the other hand, we must also be wary of drifting towards the Chinese model of using data to monitor people. Because it is the people who produce the data, they must also own and control it. City Dramaturg Tunde Adefioye from City Theatre of Brussels explained the lay of the land when it comes to truly equal urban and social policies. He asked an important question: how can we promote an open and equal city, if the decision-makers never come face to face with all of the realities that the residents must confront? The question emphasises the importance of diversity in decision-making bodies. If cities and other bodies are developed without listening to marginalised groups, politics cannot be truly equal.Brent\\nToderian, who has developed cities on all continents for the past 25\\xa0years, gave the closing speech of the afternoon. Toderian reminded us that plans are not enough to mitigate the climate crisis. We must also act on our plans, and in Helsinki we can promote the implementation of climate goals by expanding the pedestrian district in the City centre. All in all, city development should put the pedestrian first, because cities designed for cars are not even ideal for motorists. For this reason, cycling should not be promoted at the cost of pedestrian walkways: the right solution is to do it at the expense of car lanes.The second day of the conference took a more in-depth approach to the themes of the previous day, ensuring that the conference would become more than just words. The day was kicked off by State Secretary Jari Partanen, who emphasised that Helsinki, as one of the most ambitious emissions reducers, plays a key role in climate action, and that enabling effortless mobility is an important means of reducing emissions. Climate action should focus on people and remember to look to the future in addition to the present. Jyrki\\nKatainen made a video appearance and talked about European climate measures, such as funding mechanisms for urban technology development. The Urban Innovative Actions initiative, for example, is currently accepting applications, and five Finnish cities have already secured funding.The speeches were followed by the publication of the joint Helsinki Impact Declaration by Helsinki, Stockholm and Tallinn. The declaration outlines tangible planning solutions. The declaration stresses the significance of systemic change through means covered during the conference: cities must invest in combating climate change, working towards developing a human-centric internet and ethical use of technology, improving urban environments through spatial planning and facilitating social equality and more inclusive cities.For the rest of the afternoon, participants had the chance to choose a small group of their liking and discuss data, resilient districts, the development of the Metropolitan area and digital innovations. The day, and with it the entire conference, ended with a summary of the discussions of each small group. Helsinki Impact Conference showed that we are unanimous when it comes to urban challenges, and we even seem to see eye to eye on the elements of the solutions. Learning from each other is key along with functional and innovation-promoting politics as well as confidential cooperation between the City, residents and operators at state level. A functional social contract promotes social cohesion, and reliable, human-centric data enhances and improves city services. The conference was sure to provide many people with new perspectives on the resolution of global urban challenges, and hopefully bred new coalitions that are ready to experiment with solutions.The conference\\nwebsite and videos can be found at\\xa0\\xa0www.hel.fi/hic2019', \"The Helsinki City Board approved at its meeting on 21 October 2019 the proposal for the 2020 Budget and the proposal for the 2020-2022 Financial Plan.The approved proposal is based on the agreed result of the negotiations between the council groups represented in the City Board.

After the test renovations and drying processes are completed, the renovations to the hospital building will start on 15 October 2019. The City of Helsinki will be in charge of the renovations. The floors will be dried and floor materials changed in all areas with excessively damp concrete tiles. We are currently comparing the qualities of various materials and selecting the suitable material for the floors. According to the test drying and renovations, drying the concrete tiles of a single floor may take a year, at the maximum. The selected surface material affects the duration of the drying process. According to the indoor air analyses made, the humidity measured under vinyl floor membranes does not impact the indoor air in the hospital. The moisture of the concrete tiles has weakened the vinyl floors’ attachment to the surface.', 'The Night of the Homeless, an annual theme day focusing on poverty and social exclusion, is celebrated on 17 October 2019.

They both are strengthening previous surveys: Finland offers an excellent business environment for industries that require skilled labor and are based on high-value jobs.According to the recent EY Attractiveness Survey, Finland attracted again most foreign investments in the Nordics. Finland has kept the leading position now for seven years in a row. The most attractive industries in Finland were ICT, Health and consulting services. “The strength of Finland is versatility among other things. Finland has been able to attract investment to several sectors”, the CEO of EY Finland Mikko Äijälä comments on the press release of EY.When the survey compared Nordic cities, Helsinki was clearly number one with its’ 95 investment projects. For instance Stockholm had 33 and Copenhagen 32 projects last year. Also Espoo (17) and Vantaa (11) attracted significant amount of projects. So the whole Greater Helsinki had total number of 123 investment projects last year. Few of the assets in Greater Helsinki, according to Mikko Äijälä, are the start-up friendliness and atmosphere that supports innovation. These create an attractive business environment for many foreign companies.IBM Global Location Trends report presents and analyzes the latest developments in corporate location selection around the world. Finland and Greater Helsinki were in the TOP 5 destinations when the survey compared the average project value based on the value of jobs. This supports other surveys and reports that Greater Helsinki is very competitive globally when it comes to the high-value industries.One sector where Helsinki outperforms year after year is ICT and tech and no wonder. According to an external survey ordered by Helsinki Business Hub and Business Finland, Finland has significant skills resources across all technical skills areas. Only Greater Helsinki has 83 000 IT professional and when commuters are added, the number of experts rises to 152 000. The survey also points out that Finland stands out with interdisciplinary skills. A high percentage of the workforce has other technical skills experience too.

The oldest quays date from pre-war times and the most recent quay in Hernesaari was taken into use in the spring of 2019,” says Planning Engineer Tero Sievänen from Port Technical Services.The quays are constantly being worn down by the sea and the weather conditions. Maintaining quays in the Port of Helsinki requires skill and a good concept of the condition of the underwater structures.Underwater steel sheet walls and reinforced concrete poles as well as the erosion protection structures at the front of the quays bear the brunt of the rough sea and northern weather conditions. The erosion protection structures are designed to shield the port basin and quays from the erosion caused by slipstreams generated by vessels.The underwater condition of quays can be examined using several methods, from traditional condition surveys performed by divers to digital multi-beam probes and modelling.Condition surveys performed by divers are slow and relatively expensive, but result in detailed and comprehensive reports. Diving will not work very well, however, if the water is murky and the diver cannot see farther than their own hand.Digital surveys, on the other hand, can be used to gain a more comprehensive perspective more quickly.All of the quays in the Port of Helsinki have been surveyed by diving at least once. Check-ups using multi-beam echo sounding are performed every few years by port area.Read more:Port of Helsinki', 'The island of Vallisaari will have a modern water supply and sewage network provided by the City of Helsinki and Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY). The network will be connected to the HSY water supply and sewage system by a pipeline running on the bottom of the sea between Suomenlinna and Vallisaari.\\xa0Construction starts with the marking of the course of the pipeline with buoys in the sea area between Suomenlinna and Vallisaari. Excavation work for the pipeline started at Länsi-Musta in Suomenlinna in the week of 7 October. Pipes will be laid later in the autumn.\\xa0The work will be conducted largely on sea lanes for boats and ships. The work may cause minor disruptions to boating but will not interfere with the movement of larger vessels on the sea lanes. The work will also involve some underwater excavation.\\xa0The goal is to complete pipe laying by the end of the year. However, depending on winter and ice conditions, pipe laying may have to wait until the spring. Autumn storms may also slow the work. The contractor for the project is GRK Infra Oy.\\xa0\\xa0The water supply and sewage network of Vallisaari is built by Metsähallitus (a Finnish governmental organization that includes parks and wildlife administration). The project to develop the network was launched last summer.\\xa0\\nProject-related construction on Vallisaari will continue through the rest of the autumn. It is forbidden to go ashore and to move on the island during 7–11 November 2019. The restrictions are due to removal of old explosives and work-related, required safety zones.\\xa0The water supply and sewage network will improve services on Vallisaari. For visitors, this will mean flush toilets rather than dry toilets. Entrepreneurs will enjoy improved conditions for restaurant, café and other operations.\\xa0\\nThe construction of the Vallisaari water supply and sewage network forms a part of the future detailed plan for the area. The plan will support the development of the island further as a nature destination. The twin islands Vallisaari and the adjacent Kuninkaansaari are located next to Suomenlinna and can be reached by ferry from Helsinki Market Square in 20 minutes.

The summit focused on the concept of Smart Cities, Smart Destinations.\\n  In line with the UN’s New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, smart cities have the potential to make cities more manageable, accessible and environmentally friendly for both residents and tourists. UNWTO’s international tourism summit focused on how the cities can address complex urban challenges.\\n The declaration that was approved for signing at the summit recalls, among other things, that 60 per cent of the world’s population will live in urban areas by 2030 and that cities are increasingly popular as tourism destinations. The declaration also includes a commitment to developing tourism through the furthering of innovations, technology, accessibility and sustainable development in tourism. It also includes a commitment to promote a culture of open data and new approaches to technology, such as mobility-as-a-service smartphone solutions. \\n – When Helsinki succeeds in its ambition to be the most functional City in the world to its residents, then we are also an interesting city for tourists. The City is a platform for new innovations and offers open data - using these elements we work with our partners to make a better City, step by step, said Deputy Mayor Pia Pakarinen in her speech. \\n Helsinki has been a pioneer in the development of sustainable and digital tourism services. Last year, Helsinki received the first prize, with Lyon of France, in the European Capital of Smart Tourism Competition and the best place in Juniper Research’s study concerning digital tourism services. Helsinki is currently drafting a programme for sustainable tourism, in which the City takes a stand on several sectors of tourism.

The visit is\\nset to deepen Helsinki’s cooperation with one of the most important world\\ncities. As they meet, mayors Jan Vapaavuori and Chen Jining will sign a\\nfour-year intercity cooperation agreement, whose themes stretch from city\\nplanning to environmental conservation and cooperation in the field of\\ninnovation.Mayor Chen is the leader of the world’s largest capital city by population. Cooperation with Beijing, a city of 21 million people, is a key theme in Helsinki's international strategy. Nurturing a close relationship between the cities opens up opportunities not only for developing Helsinki’s own operations, but also for exporting Finnish expertise to China.“The importance of international city-level cooperation is constantly growing. We have been determined in our efforts to develop our relationship with Beijing. Cooperation in areas such as tourism, education and cultural exchange has been intense in recent years. Now, we want to strengthen our partnership with one of the leading world cities further. Together we are able to find solutions to global challenges that cities are faced with, such as better measurement of air quality or the use of digitalisation in urban development”, Mayor Vapaavuori asserts.The number of Chinese tourists coming to Helsinki has doubled in a short space of time. Helsinki wants to tap into the growing interest to visit here and to be a pioneer in developing services for Chinese travellers. The basis for the close relationship between Helsinki and China has been built by Finnair's strong Asia strategy, as a result of which there are currently around 50 direct flights per week from Helsinki to China.One of the most visible elements of this cooperation is the Chinese New Year’s celebration, which since 2007 has been observed in Helsinki’s city centre. Last year, the event was expanded with a business-oriented parallel programme.Mayor Chen will hear about cutting-edge research in information technology, artificial intelligence, air quality and 5G technology during a visit at the University of Helsinki. New learning environments and digital learning tools will be introduced to the Beijing delegation at a Helsinki comprehensive school. The programme also includes visits to Helen Ltd.'s underground heat pump plant, cultural sites in Helsinki and local companies.The visit will culminate in a dinner hosted by Mayor Vapaavuori, which will include not only the top management of the cities but also leaders from Finnish business and cultural life.\", 'A unique feature of Helsinki is the city’s 130-kilometre-long waterfront route open to use by citizens and service providers. It will be increasingly easy in the future to develop services for waterfront areas. A new charting of service sites compiled in the summer of 2019 currently contains 120 possible sites for various activities such as cafés and water sports. In addition, waterfront route signage is being tested and under public evaluation.In accordance with the Helsinki Maritime Strategy, services in waterfront areas and signage on the waterfront route will be improved on the basis of resident feedback and feedback gathered through participatory budgeting.\\nThe charting of new service sites on the waterfront route is based on interviews of waterfront area zoning representatives and area planners, as well as on detailed plans, reports and other plans. The data, gathered for the first time for the entire length of the waterfront, eases the work of City experts, entrepreneurs and other actors looking for suitable sites for their operations. New sites for operations will be handed over mainly through public application procedures.Six new signage models have been created for waterfront signage, and these models are now on public display and can be commented on, for example, on the social media accounts of the City of Helsinki Urban Environment division. Public feedback will be used as a basis for the design of the signage, which will be placed on waterfronts in the summer of 2020. The first routes with signs will be a tour of the inner city and a tour around Laajalahti.\\xa0“Shorelines form the forefront of Helsinki’s maritime region. They are now being strengthened to serve everybody by improving signage, by easing the operations of entrepreneurs and by other means. Entrepreneurs have requested from us a better overall picture of what operations are suitable for different sites on waterfronts. The goal of the maritime strategy work now under way is to strengthen opportunities to increase services on waterfronts and, at the same time, to attract investments and to create jobs,” says Minttu Perttula, project manager for the Helsinki Maritime Strategy.Helsinki’s maritime areas planned comprehensivelyThe charting of maritime service sites combines the visions of planners, the ideas of entrepreneurs and the wishes of residents.“Possible sites for new services on Helsinki waterfronts are now for the first time compiled onto the same map, to be available for all. The planning of waterfront areas is a balancing act between nature conservation values and the appeal of recreational uses. It is of utmost importance to secure the conservation of fragile maritime nature and, bearing that in mind, planning must recognize sites on waterfronts that can withstand recreational uses. Other sites are marked unavailable for active use,” says Meri Louekari, an architect for maritime areas.The charting was conducted especially to serve entrepreneurs with the objective of continuing the work later on.“The charting serves as a new tool that eases cooperation between entrepreneurs and the City. It helps us to diversify and to increase waterfront services,” says Suvi\\nTuiskunen, a business liaison at the City of Helsinki Economic Development division, who works with maritime and other entrepreneurs.Read more:Sites for new services on the Helsinki\\nwaterfront route – a brochure in FinnishSites for new maritime services on Service\\nMapHelsinki Maritime StrategyParticipationInformation for businesses', 'Port of Helsinki has made a repeat order for Cavotec’s MoorMaster™ automated mooring system as part of wider efforts to optimize safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Helsinki’s goal is to be carbon-neutral by the year 2035. Currently, more than half of Helsinki’s carbon dioxide emissions originate from the production of energy used for heating. Reaching the carbon-neutrality goal requires, in addition to the other actions, that the emissions originating from the production of heat are reduced significantly.The Finnish government has decided to place a ban on the burning of coal for energy production by 2029. As more than half of all the heating energy used in Helsinki is still produced using coal, this ban will have a major impact on the City. Helsinki does not want to settle for the most obvious solution and replace the use of coal with biomass, because biomass is not a problem-free and sustainable energy source either, due to carbon dioxide emissions and biodiversity issues and to questions related to the availability and transport of biomass.In order to find answers for a truly sustainable, long-term and holistic energy solution for Helsinki, the Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori has launched the global one million euro Helsinki Energy Challenge. The question of the challenge is simple – how to replace coal with as much carbon-neutrality as possible and with as little biomass as possible.The competition is arranged to provide all parties with an equal opportunity to bring their solutions to the table for evaluation on the same terms. Helsinki Energy Challenge invites solution and technology developers globally to propose their solutions. Helsinki Energy Challenge will be open globally for all – for companies, consortiums, research institutions, universities and others.Helsinki will also challenge other cities to join in and work to solve the question of emissions-free heating. In addition to solving Helsinki’s own challenge, the Helsinki Energy Challenge aims to find solutions with potential to solve global decarbonisation targets outside Helsinki and Finland as well.“Climate change is the most crucial challenge of our time and Helsinki is one of the leading cities championing the fight against it. Helsinki Energy Challenge aims to find solutions for Helsinki but also more broadly for other cities around the world. Our partners will play a key role in achieving this goal. The C40 network collaborates with the Challenge already at the development phase. World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council is one of our partners in ensuring our success and the global relevance of the Challenge”, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The preparation of the competition is underway. The planned duration of the competition is about one year. The competition’s start date and registration details will be published later. Helsinki encourages interdisciplinary and innovative discussions, challenging the most obvious solutions in energy production. The background information of Helsinki’s current heating system has been published on the energychallenge.hel.fi website, to make sure that those interested in the topic can already start preparing for the competition.

This is for instance what smoothness in daily life could be like in a near future, as Helsinki is turning increasingly digitalised:Services when you\\nneed them – familiarise yourself with the brochure and the digitalisation\\nwebsiteHelsinki’s digitalisation objectives have been compiled for the first time into a brief and compact brochure\\nabout municipal digitalisation (pdf).You may also keep abreast of Helsinki’s advances in digitalisation by following the digi.hel.fi website, where you will find news as well as information about events, objectives and practical action with regard to digitalisation efforts by the City of Helsinki. The website will also carry stories about how digitalisation affects you, depending on whether you are a resident, an entrepreneur or e.g. a municipal employee.Helsinki is not the only one to have chosen this path. The City is cooperating closely with, among others, the cities of New York and London in order to seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence, open data and digital innovations in the best way possible.Follow Helsinki’s advances in digitalisation on digi.hel.fi and debate on Twitter using hashtag #digihelsinki.', 'The safety and traffic arrangements of the worksites of Helen and Helen Electricity Network were under thorough scrutiny of the worksite cyclist for the summer. Safety observations will evolve into measures in the planning of worksites and the development of a contracting model.Worksite cyclist Aleksi Pippuri, who cycled about a thousand kilometres and visited a total of 150 worksites over the summer, made safety observations that resulted in both immediate and long-term changes in worksite arrangements.“It has been rewarding to see the results of my work in real time in the reporting system for safety observations. The worksites reacted to my feedback and remedial measures were carried out promptly,” says Pippuri.The safety observations made by the worksite cyclist are now examined at Helen as a whole and they are used in the development of worksite arrangements.“In future, we will be even more proactive in the planning of worksites and in communicating about them,” says Helen’s Construction Manager Lauri Utriainen.In accordance with his job title, the worksite cyclist moved about on his bicycle, and he also studied the traffic arrangements from the pedestrians’ point of view. It is important to Helen that the worksites are safe and the traffic arrangements are smooth for all, regardless of their mode of transport.“The work has opened my eyes to the city’s infrastructure: I have stood at the edge of worksite excavations and seen how electricity and hot water are conducted to the homes of local residents. Everything that keeps this city running is beneath the streets,” says Pippuri.Read more:Helen', 'The Helsinki energy company Helen is building Finland’s largest heat storage facility in former underground oil storage caves in the Mustikkamaa island. The reconverted caves will store hot water. The amount of hot water that can be stored in the caves corresponds to 40 times the amount of water in the pools of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. The underground heat storage facility will reduce Helen’s carbon dioxide emissions by 21,000 tonnes.\\xa0The heat storage facility is one of Helen’s many solutions on the company’s path towards carbon-neutral energy production.\\nConstruction work in the underground spaces for the facility’s equipment and in a tunnel is now fully under way. In addition, district heat pipes are being installed from the Hanasaari power plant area to Sompasaari and to the underground district heat storage facility. The heat storage facility will be connected to the district heat network with the help of an existing tunnel that runs from the Hanasaari area under the sea and Sompasaari to the Mustikkamaa island.\\xa0The Mustikkamaa heat storage facility will make the energy system increasingly flexible, as the charging and discharging of energy will help to ease peak demand for heat. As the energy of the storage facility is discharged, it can be utilized as such as district heat.\\xa0The Mustikkamaa heat storage facility will be completed and ready for production in 2021.\\nRead\\nmore in a blog from Helen (in Finnish)', \"The City of Helsinki's Kalasatama Digital Twins project won the international Cities Visionary Award, as well as the Judges’ Supreme Award, which is the main award of the entire event, at the\\n  TechFest event arranged in London at the end of September.\\nThe award strengthens Helsinki’s intention of being a leading digitalisation city in the world. The award shows that Helsinki’s persevering work to make use of new technology in the City’s services and development has been recognised and acknowledged widely by professionals around the world.Digital\\ntwin is creating the most functional City in the worldA digital twin makes it possible to use modelling to plan and study the city even before the actual implementation of the projects. A way of doing things, which is based on data models, makes it possible to analyse data and observe systems both to improve future planning and to foresee problem situations. The idea of a digital twin is not a new one, as, for example, the first Helsinki 3D city models were made of the Kamppi area as early as in 1987.During the last few years, Helsinki has taken giant leaps in the 3D modelling of the City. A digital twin means a way of planning, testing and building products and services in a virtual environment before the physical production phase. In the industry sector, similar industrial modelling has been conducted for some time and according to a study, its monetary savings has been about 10 % of the total costs of the operations.”Helsinki aims to be the city in the world that best capitalises on digitalisation. Digitalisation and making use of digital tools also hold a special instrumental value in the carrying out of Helsinki’s vision to be the most functional City in the world, which offers the most fluent urban everyday life to its residents. I am proud that the work done by Helsinki also receives international appreciation and praise”, notes Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Helsinki\\nis a global pioneer of city data modellingDigital city modelling is growing globally, but Helsinki is clearly heading the development with its own work. Other progressive cities and collaboration partners are Rotterdam and Singapore. A big part of Helsinki’s progressiveness has to do with the open data that Helsinki offers to its partners and how it enables a change in the work and approach towards increasingly open and information-based, tested city development. Helsinki has made digital twin models of the Kalasatama area, which are more detailed than the models of the entire City. The Kalasatama Digital Twins report includes, among other things, the technologies used by Helsinki and it is thus also a way to help other cities that are interested in digital modelling.Digitalisation\\nis a huge opportunity for the global city developmentInternational cooperation is at the core of digital modelling. For the cities, it is a way to better meet the global challenges of city development. By means of modelling, it is possible to truly create better life in an ecologically sustainable world. The UN has estimated that globally around 2.5 billion people will move from the countryside to cities before the year 2050.”If similar figures to the 10 % cost savings of the industry sector could be reached globally in city construction efficiency through digital modelling of cities, then cities could be built for 250 million people “for free” using savings. In addition to this, significant improvements can also be reached in the optimisation of carbon neutral cities and in the maintenance of existing structures”, says Jarmo Suomisto, Project Manager for Helsinki's 3D model.Helsinki has carried out a pilot study for the digital twin model especially in Kalasatama, where the City offers high-quality 3D models as open data to all operators and collaboration partners. The City’s wish is that these city model platforms would further the diverse product development, research, education and innovation activities in the field and contribute to increasing the understanding of the great potential of digitalisation in city development.Helsinki’s competition project can be studied in further detail on this video.Further\\ninformation:Study the Kalasatama wind simulation\\n  in video format.\", \"Helsinki Impact Conference will this week bring a great number of decision-makers, researchers and urban policy influencers, who take an interest in sustainable city development, to the Music Centre in Helsinki. As host of the Conference, the City of Helsinki wishes to boost inter-city cooperation, which is needed to solve global problems and to tighten the European community. “Cities create opportunities for smooth and good every-day life. They are trendsetters and a platform for the most important solutions of a sustainable future when it comes to energy production, development of balanced neighbourhoods or digitalisation that improves services”, reminds Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki, who will open the Conference.“At the same time, the cities’ role and significance grows when it comes to solving the global challenges in society. Therefore, the cities should have more say when decisions on these matters are taken around European and international tables.”\\nThe invitation-only event on 9–10 October is aimed at leaders, developers, scientists and urban policy makers in European cities. The speaker line-up is world-class: it includes the likes of Canadian Brent Toderian, who inspires us to create livelier and increasingly solid cities, and Italian Francesca Bria, who illustrates the social values of digitalisation.The entire programme of the Conference and presentations of the speakers can be found at hel.fi/hic2019.

Helsinki Impact Conference is one of the City of Helsinki’s main events during Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union.Helsinki is in many respects a forerunner of sustainable city development. For example, Helsinki is the first European city that has committed to the reporting on the UN’s sustainable development goals, and it now challenges other European cities to join the sustainable city development. The cornerstones of Helsinki’s sustainable development are its aim to reach carbon neutrality and equal urban planning.“In Helsinki, the sustainable solutions are not only environmental-friendly and energy-efficient, but they also build on the overall wellbeing of citizens and dynamic residential environments”, Mayor Vapaavuori points out.“Internal cohesion in Europe arises from prosperous cities and neighbourhoods. Helsinki has in its strategy pledged to go on preventing segregation as a top example and to advance equality and well-being in the neighbourhoods.” Helsinki's solutions on sustainable city development have been brought up during Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, which started in July.

The responses stress that the residents want to make art and culture an even more diverse and visible part of everyday life than before.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n   The visions for the future described by the respondents highlight megatrends such as equality, internationality and multiculturalism, nature and sustainable development, community and participation. Events are emphasised as a singular theme. The respondents want Helsinki to host all kinds of events from large, world-class events to block parties and underground gatherings all year round in the near future. People also want to secure the necessary resources and premises for art. Furthermore, people want art and culture to become an even more integral and tangible part of everyday life and a more visible part of the design of public spaces and areas, quite literally. In terms of age groups, the need for art and culture services for children and young people is emphasised.\\xa0A short online survey on what residents would like art and culture to look like in Helsinki in 2030 was open to the public between 22 May and 31 August 2019. Respondents were encouraged to examine the issue from many viewpoints, e.g. who should produce art and culture, where art and culture could be experienced and made as well as what aspects of art and culture should be better acknowledged.

In order to sustain the vitality of industry and commerce in Helsinki, the region must be able to attract a substantial amount of additional international skill from abroad. To be able to meet these needs, Helsinki will improve its English-language services by 2021, entailing all its divisions. The improvements will be felt especially in the City’s digital services and in its customer service.At the outset of 2019, the proportion of residents who speak a foreign language as their native tongue was 15.7 percent of all Helsinkians, and the English-speaking Helsinkians’ share of the whole foreign-language population was 6.6 percent. That is to say, there are slightly over 6,700 English-speaking Helsinkians. It has been estimated that the size of Helsinki’s foreign-language population will grow by almost 100,000 people up until year 2035. Thus according to the estimate, just above one-quarter of all Helsinki inhabitants will be foreign-language residents. Moreover, for many immigrants, English serves as a support language before and as they develop language skills in Finnish or Swedish.The City will improve the services for immigrants e.g. by regularising the operations of International House Helsinki that is a joint pilot project of the City’s immigrant counselling and several other players. The City will set up a centralised English-language employment, training and housing counselling service at International House Helsinki. In future, English-language counselling regarding employment and education will be provided at the counselling desk of the Employment Service Marketplace, too.Presentations of daycare centres, schools and educational institutions, the most essential guides as well as registration and application forms for parents and students will be provided in English in future. The student admission and the practices for the implementation of suitability tests will be developed to facilitate for arrivals to apply to English and bilingual training. Helsinki will also endeavour to lobby the government with the aim to enable the passing of even the matriculation examination in English in the future. The health stations’ appointment scheduling will in future be provided also in English, both online and on the phone. Furthermore, the City aims at providing the customers with important care instructions as well as patient and client records in English, when necessary.The Culture and Leisure Division will increase the volume of English-language activities, especially for the young and for children. In addition, course registration and multilingual communications will be developed.As for housing-related issues, a centralised English-language counselling system will be set up. The objective is also for the City’s housing subsidiaries to have English-language web pages in the future.In addition to increasing the English-language content on the municipal websites and to mending the digital service paths, the City will survey the language skills of staff whose work involves providing service and counselling to clients. The staff’s language skills will be labelled in a clearly visible manner.Development Agenda for the English-Language Services (pdf)', 'The Outpatient Clinic for Functional Disorders of Helsinki University Hospital HUS has been operating since May 2019. The clinic treats patients whose symptoms appear to have no apparent cause. The clinic seeks to control and to reduce such symptoms. In addition to patient care, the clinic conducts research and develops the treatment of functional disorders on the basis of the research.\\xa0\\xa0The clinic’s personnel comprises a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist and a social worker.\\xa0Functional disorders comprise a wide range of diverse disorders and varying syndromes. In the early stages of its operation, the clinic focuses on the treatment of patients who have been examined carefully at other HUS units but whose disorders cannot be shown to have an exact cause with currently available examination tools.\\xa0There is no uniform medical care recommendation for functional disorders in Finland yet. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has been preparing a statement on the treatment of functional disorders but has not released the final version of this statement. In addition, the preparation of a medical care recommendation for the chronic fatigue syndrome is about to get under way.\\xa0“As we wait for Finnish medical care recommendations, the clinic utilizes international care recommendations and knowledge based on empirical research on the impact of the treatment of functional disorders. Our clinic is not associated with any single international unit, and we keep an open and inquisitive mind regarding emerging care practices,” says Chief Physician Helena\\nLiira at HUS.\\xa0Scientific understanding of the causes of functional disorders keeps developing, and the specialists associated with the clinic’s operations monitor new research findings constantly. The clinic is also about to begin its own research.\\xa0The Outpatient Clinic for Functional Disorders is also tasked to develop the treatment of functional disorders.

In this regard, the help offered by 230 Helsinki residents is furthering the planning of the city’s Central Park in an increasingly sustainable direction.On a ten-kilometre route along the River Vantaa, from Töölönlahti Bay to Haltiala, there are altogether 1,100 hectares of forest in a nearly natural state. The park is home to foxes, brown hares, weasels and many other animals. If you are in luck, you may even spot a falcon gliding above the trees.In addition to animals, you will meet runners, cross-country cyclists, commuters and bird-watchers in the forest. Any one of them may well be participating in research.Helsinki’s Central Park, running through Helsinki and Vantaa, is a research topic of particular interest to Korpilo, since more than two million visits are made to the park every year – almost as many as all of Finland’s national parks put together.Korpilo’s doctoral dissertation focuses on the use of the park for leisure, and how related data can be utilised in the park’s further planning, as well as to protect its ecosystem.Korpilo’s research partners were the City of Helsinki and park visitors. Together with volunteers, she conducted citizen science.The city wanted to engage citizens and hear what they had to say about making Central Park as enjoyable as possible for all. Instead of investigating people’s movements in the forest by conducting a survey, Korpilo employed the volunteers’ smartphones and GPS data.As they moved about in the forest, exercise applications on their phones collected data on their movements. A route map was generated after each run, cycling trip or dog walk, which the participants could then upload to a website compiling the data. At the same time, the volunteers responded to a short survey, providing background information and describing the factors affecting their route choices.\\nThe more that data was entered into the site, the more accurate was the view Korpilo and the City of Helsinki gained concerning forest usage and development needs.According to Korpilo, problem-solving and engaging ordinary people in research are clearly trending activities. Advanced technology accessible to consumers has been the biggest agent of change.Change also democratises science. That happens out of necessity, since research often involves human habitats, which people have the right to influence.“If you are trying to solve social or environmental problems, you can’t exclude the people whose lives will be affected by the choices made. Engaging people in research helps them have a say in their own surroundings and, consequently, society.”Engaging is not the only issue. Locals or individuals who have focused on a certain species often possess better knowhow than scholars themselves.“Science requires human power,” Korpilo summarises.As a rule, it is easy to get people to take part in citizen science projects. They only need to be sufficiently passionate about the subject matter in question. Some people are map enthusiasts, others are very interested in birds or stars. If that passion can be harnessed to benefit the common good, even better.Indeed, Korpilo encourages everyone to google for citizen science projects, for example by writing one’s area of interest followed by “citizen science” in the search field. Certain projects employ exceedingly peculiar ways of conducting research.\\n\\nResearcher\\nSilviya \\n\\nKorpilo: An evening\\njog in the park provides useful data for researchersRead more:University of HelsinkiCentral Park Study', 'The Helsinki City Board approved a project plan for new M300 Metro trains at its meeting of 23 September 2019. The total cost of the proposed project is EUR 40.7 million euros. The final decision on the project plan will be made by the Helsinki City Council.\\xa0\\nThe project plan concerns an acquisition of five four-car Metro trains of series M300. The resulting expansion of the Metro fleet would allow the frequency of Metro trains to be increased, and it would ensure that the Metro system’s capacity would be adequate to meet the needs of increasing ridership as the West Metro expands.\\xa0\\nAt the moment, the highest number of Metro trains in service is 36, which translates into 80-percent capacity utilization. The realization of a call option to acquire new M300 Metro trains and an increase in the fleet utilization rate would enable the number of trains to be increased to 43 from the end of 2023 onwards.\\xa0The Metro operator Helsinki City Transport cannot serve expanding ridership by raising the utilization rate of the current fleet. Consequently, an acquisition of new Metro trains cannot be avoided.\\xa0The City Board also approved for City Council consideration the raising of the price ceiling for the expansion and renovation of the Mäkelänrinne Upper Secondary School, stated in the expansion and renovation project plan, by 3.8 million euros. As a result, the total cost of the project without value added tax should be no more than 20.8 million euros without value added tax at April 2019 cost levels.\\xa0The expansion and renovation project is part of the Urhea Campus construction at Mäkelänrinne, combining studies, sports and housing. The project plan comprises an extensive technical renovation in the current upper secondary school building and an expansion that will link the upper secondary school with Urhea Hall to be built at the same site and with student housing to be built at an adjoining site.\\xa0Furthermore, the City Board approved a land use plan to be signed with VR-Yhtymä Oy related to a detailed plan alteration in the area of Maaherrantie in Veräjämäki.

From January 2020 onwards, the centre’s operations will be transferred to other Youth Services’ facilities in accordance with the plans to regionalise cultural youth work. Suitable facilities are currently being sought. The condition and ventilation of Harju Youth Centre were surveyed in spring 2019. Based on the deficiencies found in the surveys, the youth centre will undergo maintenance repairs and follow-up surveys in the autumn, with the aim of providing a comprehensive impression of the current condition of the building. After this, a repair plan and cost estimate will be prepared for more extensive repairs, based on which decisions will be made on follow-up measures. Decisions on the future use of the Harju property will be made by committees after the preparation of the repair plan (the Urban Environment Committee and the Culture and Leisure Committee).“We want to ensure an environment for young people and employees that supports operations in the best possible way.

The number of events has more than doubled from last year: Helsinki’s day care centres, schools and educational institutions will be organising over 200 events related to learning around the city.The event week programme emphasises the voice of the learner, well-being and comprehensive learning. The week promises to filled with a wide variety of events organised by learners, such as workshops and discussion sessions, focusing on topics such as coming up with ways to increase participation, showcasing people’s own enterprises, relaxing the body and mind and coming up with ideas for and preparing new school lunches. Many of the events also will involve learning with the help of new technologies, such as robotics and game platforms.Helsinki Education Week events are all free of charge. The events are aimed at groups of children and pupils, teachers, principals, parents and guardians as well as companies – i.e. anyone interested in learning and the development thereof. The target audience also includes international education experts.Another related event being held in the same week is the HundrED Innovation Summit, which will include the announcement of one hundred interesting education innovations for 2020. The event will bring together approximately 250 education experts, innovators and funders from around the world, as well as over 100 other education sector professionals interested in Finnish education from the Netherlands and Mexico, among other countries.. Last year, the event was attended by visitors from 37 different countries.The main organiser of the event week is the City of Helsinki and the City’s Education Division.

Residents and visitors appreciate the peace of the recreation areas, but they also find that there is a lack of services. The Urban Eco Islands project exploits smart solutions, e.g. aerial drone images, to monitor and manage recreational use in order to preserve the natural values.Helsinki will open up new islands for recreational use according to its maritime strategy. Last summer, the City enabled more visits to the island of Vasikkasaari next to Suomenlinna by regular boat service, as the City enabled more extensive use of the island. This particular island is also a development object of the Urban Eco Islands project that was launched recently. The same project involves the development of the island of Aegna off the city of Tallinn.There is substantial fluctuation as to the number of visitors to the natural areas depending on the day of the week or the season and on the accessibility of the place and how well known it is. Using a visitor counter, the City has now for instance for more than a year been monitoring the number of visitors using the popular and accessible footbridge path to the Helsinki island of Lammassaari. During peak season, there have been approximately 2,200 visitors walking the Lammassaari footbridge in the span of 24 hours, while the annual number of visits to the area is about 138,000. This is equivalent to the annual number of visitors to the Repovesi national park in Southeast Finland.Vasikkasaari was opened to a larger public only last summer, and hence it being not so well known was reflected in fewer visitors compared with other similar natural objects this past summer.The City intends to add visitor counters to the Helsinki area of Vanhankaupunginlahti and to other natural areas in the City as well. Thanks to the counters, the City will be able to identify the most popular natural objects and assess how the number of visitors affects the environment in each particular case.“Data about the number of visitors help us plan the paths, the rest areas and the information boards of the natural areas. We steer the visitor flows towards marked paths in order to preserve the diversity and the beauty of the environment”, says Kaisa Pajanen, head of team at Helsinki’s environmental services.As part of the Urban Eco Islands project, Forum Virium, which is the City of Helsinki’s innovation company, will test smart solutions to monitor the nature and the environment on Vasikkasaari.New and developing technology will enable, among other things, the use of drones, in this case small rotorcraft, to monitor the island nature.“Drone photography is fairly easy and fast in favourable weather conditions. It is easy to repeat the taking of pictures regularly, which makes it possible to more regularly than previously, through walking the terrain, e.g. monitor how the paths and the environment are being worn”, asserts environmental inspector Tuomas Lahti.Thanks to a live camera on the island, smart technology also enables you to virtually tune into the feeling of being on Vasikkasaari, something you can do e.g. during a break at work. Smart technology identifies the vessels that pass by and provides real-time data about air quality and the noise level.The City wishes to take the residents’ and the visitors’ expectations into account as it goes about developing the recreational areas. People who visited Vasikkasaari last summer through the Urban Eco Islands project were asked to respond to a survey about the area.Generally speaking, the visitors were very satisfied with their visit to the island. According to the results, almost 80 per cent of respondents rated the natural values of the island as being really important, even more important than its cultural and recreational value. On the other hand, more than half of the respondents wish there were restaurant services on the island.“On the one hand, people try to find their way from the urban beat into the peace of nature, but on the other hand they still wish that services that belong to the urban environment should be easily available”, observes Annika Harlio of Helsinki’s environmental services and the leader of the Urban Eco Islands project.The City of Helsinki is the main coordinator of the biannual Urban Eco Islands project, whose partners are Forum Virium Helsinki, the City of Tallinn and the SEI Tallinn unit, which is part of Stockholm Environment Institute. The European Regional Development Fund, Interreg Central Baltic, funds the project.Further informationUrban Eco Islands projectVasikkasaari live channelHelsinki’s maritime strategy outlines the development of the service supply and attractiveness of the archipelago and the waterfront until year 2030.

The bridge construction site will have no effect on the Jätkäsaari traffic, but the related pile-driving may cause noise.\\xa0The main work phase will consist of the construction of a pile base between the eastern end of the bridge (at the pier of Valtamerilaituri) and West Harbour Terminal 2. This will be the base of the bridge and local street structures. Piles will be driven on weekdays from 7 in the morning to 22 at night.\\nAs soon as the bridge is completed, tram line 8 will again be running to and turning around at Saukonpaasi, and tram lines 7 and 9 will be running on a “Jätkäsaari loop”, because line 7 cannot turn around owing to the West Terminal construction work.\\xa0Temporary traffic arrangements will be in place until 2022 at the Bunkkeri turn-around site. The Tahitinkatu turn-around site will be completed in the following year, that is, in 2023. Once the Tahitinkatu site is completed in 2023, the local tram line network is complete, and line 7 will run to Tahitinkatu and lines 8 and 9 to Bunkkeri.\\xa0\\nThe construction of the Atlantinsilta bridge and new tram lines will be paralleled by the construction of waterfront support walls and surrounding street areas. Other municipal infrastructure and lighting will also be constructed.\\xa0 \\xa0The breakthrough of LED lighting meant that the Jätkäsaari lighting plan, drafted since 2005, had to be redone.\\xa0Streets, parks and playgrounds have their own lighting requirements. The Jätkäsaari outdoor lighting can be recognized from half-globe shaped hanging lights and graphite-grey pylon street furniture. The pylon model was designed specifically for Jätkäsaari. Double cables are needed in the maritime district of Jätkäsaari, in order to prevent lights from swinging in high winds.\\nHanging lights are favoured in densely built city districts such as Jätkäsaari. The supporting cables of lights are fixed on building walls in the narrow streets of Jätkäsaari. On main streets, cables are fixed on pylons shared with tram lines. The final outdoor lighting can usually be built only when streets and the buildings lining the streets are complete.\\xa0The most common colour temperature of lights is 3,000 kelvins, which has the appearance of warm white.\\xa0Today all new outdoor lights in Helsinki are LED lights. Helsinki has a total of 87,000 outdoor lights. The LED technology saves a great deal of energy compared to conventional lights, which is important for the city’s goal to be carbon neutral by 2035. Lighting maintenance needs are also reduced. Conventional lights have to be replaced once in every 3–4 years, but the service life of LED lights is estimated to be 25 years. Furthermore, the efficiency of LED lighting can be adjusted freely. For example, nighttime lighting levels – and electricity consumption at the same time – could be dropped to one-fifth of normal lighting levels.\\xa0\\xa0“It’s well worth coming to admire the lighting of the Jätkäsaari bridges – Rokkiporkkana and Crusell Bridge – from longer distances,” recommend contracting manager Teemu Rinne and lighting designer Taneli Lehtonen.Read more:Jätkäsaari on Helsinki New\\nHorizons website', 'The Töölönlahti movement challenge that started in July has already amassed 20,000 kilometres.

Pitäjänmäki library will be closed for renovation from 30 September 2019 , and Paloheinä library will be closed from 7 October 2019. Both libraries will be reopened on Monday 18 November 2019. The interiors of the libraries will be refurbished and the facilities will be modernised. These renovations have been planned together with customers and staff.“The goal of the functional renovation of the facilities of Pitäjänmäki and Paloheinä libraries is to make these premises not only better libraries, but attractive resident facilities that invite people in to participate and be inspired. The library is a space for culture and leisure, and it serves the users of the nearby sports facilities in Pitäjänmäki, for example, and inspires people to get together and organise events in Paloheinä,” says Saara Ihamäki, director of regional library services at Helsinki City Library. Both Pitäjänmäki and Paloheinä library are the only local public indoor spaces available to everyone. Neighbourhood libraries are important parts of the everyday lives of local people and services that strengthen well-being in the area by offering a free and safe public space. Libraries also increase the attractiveness of districts.During the renovation, both Pitäjänmäki and Paloheinä library materials will have longer than usual loan periods, and the materials may be returned to any Helmet library in Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen. However, reserved books are subject to the loan periods issued by the original library, which means that you should check the due date on your receipt or in the Taskukirjasto application.You should select another library as your local library from now on when making reservations.

The one-day takeover is part of Plan International’s campaign, which seeks to draw the attention of the world to the discrimination met by girls, and also to the enormous potential possessed by girls.\\xa0Girls Takeover is now organized in Finland for the third time. Last year the girls of Plan International Children’s Board and a young Ugandan activist of Plan International successfully took over nine leadership positions. Globally, girls took over the offices of 2,000 leaders in 70 countries.\\xa0This year’s campaign seeks to highlight especially the impact of climate change on girls in developing countries. Therefore the offices to be taken over comprise enterprises and organizations that can influence climate change mitigation with their actions.\\xa0In addition to the Helsinki Mayor’s office, the offices to be taken over by girls comprise those of the following persons in leadership positions: Member of European Parliament Eero Heinäluoma, Jukka Leskelä, Managing Director of Finnish Energy, Tiina Alahuhta-Kasko, CEO of Marimekko, Olli Luukkainen, President of Trade Union of Education in Finland, Sara Mella, Nordea’s Head of Personal Banking, Tapio Sadeoja, Senior Editor-in-Chief of Ilta-Sanomat,\\n  Emma Koivula, Editor-in-Chief of Anna magazine, and Saku Sipola, President\\xa0and\\xa0CEO\\xa0of\\xa0SRV\\xa0Group Plc. In addition, a Cambodian activist of Plan International, Hory Toth, will take over the office of Krista Mikkonen, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.\\xa0\\xa0Mayor Vapaavuori says, “One of the major issues of justice in our times is how to secure the rights of girls and young women. The takeover is in a good position to wake up people to think about the position and opportunities of girls in Finland and elsewhere in the world. The City of Helsinki continuously promotes gender equality with concrete action, for example, by fixing salaries and wages and through an equality project and plan. The International Day of the Girl Child is a grand way to celebrate our progress, but it also reminds us all that systematic work to promote equality has to be continued, also here in Finland and in Helsinki.”\\xa0The consequences of climate change will have negative impacts especially on girls in the poorest countries of the world. Climate change will weaken the nutrition, water supply and hygiene of girls, it will increase school dropout and child marriage rates, and it will increasingly expose girls to exploitation.\\xa0However, girls in developing countries play significant roles in the climate solution. When girls are given opportunities for education and to participate in decision-making, their abilities and skills become part of the solution to the climate crisis. When girls can make decisions, the future is better for all of us.\\xa0“Climate change threatens to endanger the advances that we have already achieved in the rights of girls. Finland and the Finns must shoulder their fair share in the mitigation of climate change, and we can set an example to other nations with our action,” says Ossi Heinänen, CEO of Plan International Finland.\\xa0The purpose of the campaign is to give girls an opportunity genuinely and significantly to affect the decisions made during the day. For example, Ronja Holopainen stepped into the office of the President and CEO of Kesko Corporation last year, and as a result the corporation included the promotion and monitoring of gender equality in its responsibility criteria. This means that the corporation monitors tangibly, annually and in all parts of the world how gender equality progresses and develops in their partnering enterprises and procurement channels.\\xa0“Climate change mitigation is an important theme for me. We’re not talking about climate and nature alone but about human rights. Equality and good preconditions for life despite one’s background have always been important for me, and I feel that those are the exact things that I can impact with Girls Takeover,” says Katariina, who will be replacing the Mayor of Helsinki.', 'The Malmi Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic will operate from Herttoniemi at Siilikuja 1 from October 2019 onwards.The telephone numbers and services of the internal medicine outpatient clinic will not change for the most part.

The Helsinki City Board decided about the membership at its meeting on 16 September. According to the Helsinki City Strategy, the entire City is developed as a platform for innovations and new experiments and for a creative business policy. Also line with the City Strategy, Helsinki wants to consolidate its international profile as a design metropolis and its position as an international forerunner in inclusion and transparency.

The central pedestrian zone and underground distributor road options that are to be presented to the Urban environment committee as deserving to be elaborated will be discussed at the committee’s meeting on 17 September 2019. 18.9.: Committee will again handle the matter in two weeks time.– At this stage of planning, the preliminary impact assessments enable us to compare the ideas that have been brought forward with sufficient accuracy. However, we will be able to evaluate the feasibility of the project as a whole only later after having conducted wider assessments based on plans that are more detailed, asserts project manager Katariina Baarman, who is based at Helsinki City Executive Office.\\n– For instance, the more concrete general planning of the central pedestrian zone is just about to begin. Up until this moment, we have examined issues only on a general level, but we have not yet mulled over what tangible measures to take in this or that spot in specific streets, Baarman says.The seven idea-stage alternatives for the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the construction of an underground distributor road have subsequent to municipal studies been moulded into a proposed basis for the further planning of the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the construction of an underground distributor road.The general planning of the central pedestrian zone is intended to start based on functional considerations. As for the central pedestrian zone, Kaivokatu has in the studies so far been assumed to be a transit mall. Concerning Pohjois- and Eteläesplanadi, two options have been studied.The first option is based on both Pohjois- and Eteläesplanadi being single-lane streets, meaning that the pavement as a rule may be widened by the width of one traffic lane, whereby the Esplanade streets would remain symmetrical relative to the park. The second option assumes that there would be a unified and, compared to the current situation, clearly larger area of pedestrian streets, as Pohjoisesplanadi would serve as a pedestrian street, while Eteläesplanadi would be a 1+1 two-way street.The main tunnel of the underground distributor road is planned to be constructed from Länsiväylä to Hermannin rantatie to become mainly a 2+2 lane road with the objective of making it safe and having it last long into the future, also serving traffic to and from the harbours.\\nThe planning of the underground distributor road should clarify the following items:The Urban environment committee will begin deliberating the plans at its meeting on 17 September. The meeting agenda will be published on 13 September and be made available on hel.fi/kaupunkiymparistolautakuntaAn information meeting for the city residents regarding the expansion of the central pedestrian zone and the underground distributor road will take place 25 September 2019 at 5–6:30 p.m. at the City Hall event square.Further information:The Helsinki New Horizons web pagesInformation meeting for the city residents on 25 September (The event on Facebook)', 'SSA Group Oy begins the construction of new Hitas homes in the Koskela Hospital area in early September. Street construction and infrastructure development are also under way in the area.The Koskela Multi-service Centre and other social and health care services in the area will continue to serve as normal despite the construction project. One of the services operating in the area is self-care supplies distribution.Pedestrian routes in the area will stay unchanged for the time being, but as construction work proceeds, new routes will be built. There will be clear signs indicating new routes and to guide area users.For the time being, customers can park on the short-term parking spaces located at the main gate on Käpyläntie. Parking spaces in front of the Multi-service Centre will also remain in use. Customers can no longer drive from Koskelantie to the hospital area.Buses continue to serve the area as normal. However, construction sites may slow traffic on Koskelantie and other streets.Residential construction in the Koskela Hospital area begins from Käpyläntie 11. The area, which is the former home of the famed hospital park, will have more than 1,500 new homes for 3,000 residents.The first two multi-storey apartment buildings, with 66 Hitas homes, will be built by SSA Group Oy. The popularity of the area is evident by the fact that the homes about to go under construction have already been sold.he area will have several housing types, including Hitas homes (that is, price-regulated owner-occupied homes), right-of-occupancy homes, rental homes, housing cooperative homes and senior homes. Some buildings will have street-level business space. The new homes will be located at the edges of the Koskela Hospital area, encircling much of the old hospital park, which will be preserved. The old hospital buildings, protected in the area’s detailed plan, will be converted into homes later on, and one of the buildings to be renovated will house day care space. A new multi-service centre is scheduled for completion in 2023.Large-scale residential construction requires new streets and infrastructure. Street construction and infrastructure development went under way in spring 2019.

A new marketing campaign is being launched in September to test what type of image could attract international talent to move permanently to Helsinki.Although Helsinki already performs well in international city rankings, attracting international talent to Finland remains a challenge according to the experience of local companies.“Finnish growth companies are among the leaders in Europe in attracting investments, and hundreds of millions of euros in foreign capital have been invested in startups here. One of the barriers to their growth, however, is attracting talent. Helsinki wants to improve the city’s image as a place to live. I believe this is possible, as the majority of foreign experts who have settled in Helsinki are satisfied with the quality of life here,” says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Helsinki is stepping up its collaboration with companies in the technology sector to bolster its international reputation. Partners in the initial stage include Supercell, Smartly, Relex and MaaS Global, as well as the startup event Slush. A commonly recognised reason for the relatively low volume of newcomers is a lack of international awareness of Helsinki. Perceptions of the Finnish capital are both weak and somewhat outdated.“Finding the best talent in the world is critical for us. Helsinki is a fine city, but the threshold for coming here to check it out, let alone move here, is high. We’ve noticed that, when we do get the people we are trying to recruit to experience Helsinki for themselves, their enthusiasm ignites and they are more likely to sign an employment contract,” says Kristo Ovaska, CEO of Smartly. Helsinki’s prospects as a potential new hometown will be tested by 15 possible recruits at the next Slush startup event. A joint marketing campaign entitled “CaaS – World’s first City as a Service” is being launched this September by Helsinki Marketing, the city-owned company responsible for the city’s marketing operations, together with local technology companies. The aim of the campaign is to engage international technology experts in a surprising and distinctive way. Digital marketing will focus initially on the cities of St. Petersburg, Krakow and London.“It’s wonderful to see how Helsinki is seeking bold new initiatives in terms of international marketing. The target group will be addressed in their own native languages. You cannot attract attention by doing things the same way as others,” says Andreas Saari, CEO of Slush.International House Helsinki (IHH) offers fast and comprehensive services to foreign experts settling in Helsinki. IHH plays an important role in offering advisory services to both foreign experts arriving in Helsinki and the local companies and employers who are recruiting them. Since it opened in December 2017, IHH has offered the majority of advisory and official services required by newcomers under one roof in the Sörnäinen district of Helsinki. IHH also helps companies and employers in issues related to recruiting foreign labour.Together with its neighbouring municipalities of Espoo and Vantaa, Helsinki is also participating in the Finnish Government’s cross-administrative “Talent Boost – International Talents Boosting Growth” initiative. Within this framework, Helsinki is working in close collaboration with the State, universities and other local and regional actors to attract a skilled workforce. The aim is also to support employment opportunities for foreign experts who already live here, such as university students.Visit the campaign websiteView the campaign video', 'The City of Helsinki has opened a survey to encourage anyone interested in developing roadworks to share their experiences and ideas.

The event attracted about 500 international participants. A large share of them were Chinese.Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori is pleased with the fact that it was possible to have the network meeting take place in Helsinki. The city gained visibility and Helsinkian tourism businesses were able to show off their services.– Only less than 10 per cent of the Chinese own a passport. The tourism potential is enormous, and it is terrific that we are able to assert Helsinki so well from the viewpoint of tourism, Vapaavuori said.According to a visitor survey by Visit Finland, specifically the Chinese are the tourists who spend the most money. In the last five years, the Chinese doubled their volume of overnight stays at accommodations in Helsinki.Vapaavuori thinks that Helsinki and Finland have better learned to understand the wishes and needs of Chinese tourists.\\nJan Vapaavuori reiterates that Helsinki has been a pioneer of the Asian tourism market. The first commercial flight from China to Europe was the route between Beijing and Helsinki.\\n\\nLaura Aalto, CEO of the Helsinki Marketing city marketing company, is on her part happy about the fact that it was possible to make sustainable tourism and the effort to develop it the themes of the international event.– We here in Helsinki have fared well winning the European Capital of Smart Tourism 2019 competition is already a sign of that. We won it together with Lyon.\\nLaura Aalto is convinced that during the Helsinki event the cooperation with the international network became yet closer and was raised to a new level.\\n\\nAalto thinks that it is important for Helsinki to be able to disseminate its ideas and talk about what it is doing for sustainable tourism. The Think Sustainably web service on the MyHelsinki.fi pages was put online this summer and has attracted international attention.The role of the cities as trendsetters for developing tourism and the great importance of cooperation were topics that were pointedly present in the addresses during the event. Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, who talked about Talsinki comprising Helsinki and Tallinn, was one case in point.– Cooperation brings success. Together, Tallinn and Helsinki are bigger and have a greater impact, Kõlvart asserts.\\nTallinn joined the WTCF network last year. Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, centre, poses together with the representatives of the cities that joined the network this year.\\n\\nWTCF secretary-general Song Yu used statistics to introduce the importance of tourism. Last year, more than 1.3 billion trips abroad were made, and journeys made by Chinese rose in particular.He underlined smartness as a growing trend in tourism and emphasised that tourism that stresses smart solutions does not evolve without a strong input from cities.Professor Li Yuonpeng, an expert at WTCF, talked about a report for which Chinese travellers had been asked about their expectations concerning the travel destination.– Smart apps are among the prerequisites. Guidebooks, tickets and payment services should be digital. Working Wi-Fi connections on location are important.Present were also companies that produce smart solutions. Kaj Pyyhtiä, who represented the MaaS Global company that has developed the Whim mobility app, points out that tourism is turning increasingly individual.– Tourists want to experience the kind of things that the locals do and know what the locals favour themselves.It is a big advantage when also individual tourism is safe and easy and when practical matters may be handled using an app on the phone.Pyyhtiä commended the City of Helsinki on being a pioneer of open data. By opening up its data, the municipality generates opportunities for partners to create new services.\\nKaj Pyyhtiä says that even Chinese tourism is becoming increasingly individual.\\n\\nAt Finlandia Hall, cities that are part of the network had a chance to present their respective assets. There was a line to Helsinki’s stand, since people were there able to try virtual reality headsets and as-it-were visit a Finnish-style furnished home and Lonna Island as it appears in the summer and in the winter.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, director of economic development, said that a big plus for Helsinki that helps it attract international travellers is, among other things, the clean air and the compact size of the city.– Helsinki is for many foreigners an astonishing experience. You travel only twenty minutes from the city centre and you will find yourself deep in the forest landscape or out at sea completely at peace.She hoped that a genuine spirit of Helsinki would be transmitted to the participants of the event.\\nMarja-Leena Rinkineva hopes that the international crowd of participants will carry with them a memorable experience.\\n\\nThis is what actually happened, at the very least in the words of WTCF assistant secretary Li Baochun. He visited Helsinki for the first time in the 1990’s.\\nLi Baochun predicts that in the future Chinese travellers will stay in Helsinki for even longer periods. The city is friendly and its services are of high quality.\\n\\nHis accolades for the city amounted to a small lecture. Among other things, he praised the beauty of the city, the diversity of its culture, its suitability and facilities for winter sports, its technological skills, its good connections and the friendliness of the Helsinkians.Original text in Finnish: Kirsi RiipinenPhotos: Ilkka Ranta-ahoMore informationWorld Tourism Cities Federation 2019 SummitMy Helsinki – Think Sustainably\\xa0', \"On Thursday the 19th of September between 14-18 o’clock there will be open doors at the Kallio Family Centre, which opened last summer.

The campus will expand from its current 10,000 sq m space to 70,000 sq m by 2023 and will be led by new CEO Ville Simola. The future campus will attract approximately 650 new operators and new jobs for at least 4,000 people.Built at a former hospital complex in downtown Helsinki, Maria 01 is a non-profit campus and home to over 120 startups and scale-ups, 12 venture capital funds, several ecosystem supporters, and over 1,100 members making it currently the biggest startup cluster in the Nordics. Maria 01’s diverse network, first-rate conditions for innovation, and immediate location next to capital offer a perfect formula to help startups grow and expand.Not content with being the largest in the Nordics, new CEO Ville Simola has his eyes set on an even bigger target by making the hub the biggest in Europe after the new expansion.“I’m excited to take up the reins of this ambitious project which is sure to change the Finnish startup scene today as we know it. I see a lot of challenges in the expansion but I’m no stranger to ecosystem building after my work with Startup Sauna,” explains Maria 01 CEO Ville Simola, whose previous work saw him co-found and grow the internationally recognized premier startup accelerator Startup Sauna before venturing into the corporate world.Each and every company Maria 01 takes under its roof is chosen using strict criteria and is expected to move out after 3 years to make room for new startups and scaling companies.“The Nordics are now challenging the established large European hubs and Finnish startups are sprouting faster than ever. Currently, only 16% of the startups who apply to work at Maria 01 are accepted so the new, larger space will help us to meet the increasing demand for our curated community while bringing new jobs to the area meaning huge benefits for the community, startups, city, and economy,” continues Simola.Maria 01 is set to open a new wing of the former hospital in October 2019 under a previous agreement that will see the space double in size to 20,000 sq m ahead of the new 50,000 sq m expansion set to be completed by 2023.

The goal is to help enterprises to develop new means to produce added value for real estate owners, managers and users with solutions that utilize the IoT technology.\\xa0\\nThe Ressu Comprehensive School uses an IoT system that gathers occupancy data on nearly all learning environments of the school at five-minute intervals. In addition, sensors measure the temperature, lighting levels and humidity at these environments. The measurement data is visualized to the school staff in a report that shows available spaces almost in real time. The data on usage rates is reported to management, in order for them to form a picture of the sufficiency of the school facilities for the current number of users and current uses.\\xa0“Our goal has been to produce data on occupancy and usage rates for the purposes of the innovation competition, as it seems that school facilities are in busy use – especially in city centres. Thus there is big business potential for solutions that enable smarter use of space, both in Finland and internationally,” says the competition leader Raigo Megerild of the City of Helsinki Economic Development division.\\xa0However, the innovations entered into the competition do not have to be directly related to the use of space. It is enough that the proposed solutions utilize a part of the current system. So the innovations for the competition can involve enrichment of data, user interface development or development of sensor accuracy, as long as they are intended to produce added value for customers. The City of Helsinki has allocated 20,000 euros for the implementation of pilots.\\xa0\\xa0“All in all, data is gathered on more than 40 learning environments.

The committee has concluded that HKL will not be able to meet the pressures for change in the operational environment as long as it remains a public utility and recommends hence that the ownership model should be altered from public utility to public company.The committee recognised several key forces of change that have an impact on how HKL should be organised, e.g. the increasing role of rail transport in urban development, several new regional rail projects that are being planned and that will be linked up with Helsinki’s inner city network as well as rail transport becoming more market-determined, and possible decisions about inviting tenders for transport that has been managed by Helsinki Region Transport (HSL).The committee proposes that the entire HKL should be turned into HKL Ltd. (HKL Oy) on 1 July 2020 at the earliest. HKL Ltd. is the starting point for further development towards an operations model that will enable and support a regional approach, whose prerequisite is the participation of also the region’s other local authorities in the planning and execution of rail transport service solutions. The committee proposes that the transformation into a public company from an administrative point of view should be carried as a transfer of business where HKL’s personnel are transferred into the new company as so-called old employees.“There are several rail transport projects that are either underway or will be launched in the upcoming years. This is positive from the point of view of more sustainable and smoothly-operating urban traffic. The operational environment also changes, as some of the new projects are regional undertakings that straddle the city boundaries. From the city’s viewpoint it is essential to make sure that we will be able to measure up to the forthcoming changes and to cope with them well, and to guarantee the city residents well-running communications. Consequently, this autumn we have to consider carefully the HKL’s organisational status too as part of the whole. There is reason to discuss the item at a regional level as well”, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.“It is essential to make sure that HKL is well poised for participating in the development of urban rail transport. As the transport system evolves, the task area of rail transport will expand, and in that case, HKL’s expertise will be of value. At the same time, present and future personnel will have the opportunity to carry out duties that are motivational and future-oriented”, Deputy Mayor Anni Sinnemäki comments.On 24 January 2019, the City of Helsinki appointed a committee to look into the issue of transforming the public transport utility into a public company while taking into consideration previous reports on organisational changes, changes in the operational environment, both passed and those that are on the horizon, and the development of competitive tendering of public transport. The committee was tasked with preparing a proposal for the transformation of HKL into a public company, if justified.According to the committee, the strengths of operating as a public company are, among others:– the company structure enables, when under efficient leadership, the improvement of productivity and operations,– the model offers flexibility as for the planning of the investments, the funding and the operational economy, and it also increases transparency and target-orientation,– the large HKL complex that supports synergies and maintains the knowledge cluster will be preserved,– the model makes it possible to retain regional rail transport infrastructure and materiel in the hands of one player. This, however, requires the local authorities of the region and HSL to go along with it,– the model enables further development of the company in the future, and, for instance, dividing it in order to advance regional solutions.Further reading:HKL, final report, 6 June 2019 (pdf)The City Manager’s resolution', 'Tiivistämö is a place that offers inspiring cultural and artistic experiences, as well as the opportunity to organise events in high-quality and adaptable settings.

The City of Helsinki’s strategic policy is to develop the area into an internationally distinctive, permanent event area, and locating Tiivistämö, which is maintained by the City’s Youth Services, in the area supports this goal well, says Local Youth Work Manager Pekka Mönttinen happily.Tiivistämö will carry the torch of the Gloria Cultural Arena, which closed its doors in March, and the opening of Tiivistämö will provide Suvilahti with year-round activities and more visitors. The programme production will be carried out primarily in co-operation with various communities, event organisers and artists. The events will be targeted especially at young people and young adults. In addition to events, Tiivistämö will provide event production-related internships for numerous young people interested in the field. Tiivistämö will be opened at the Planet Suvilahti event on 21 September. The event will usher all of Suvilahti into an autumnal atmosphere of experiences, providing plenty of things to see and do for children, young people and adults alike. The opening day will also kick off Tiivistämö’s first theme month: the Flowers of Life deco collective and video artist Matlock Visuals are designing an unprecedented installation combining light and video for the opening month. Over the course of the month, all events at Tiivistämö will take place within the three-dimensional world of this work.', \"Children of immigrants in the Capital Region are on average less likely to hold an upper secondary level degree, when compared to children of natives. However, when comparing children of immigrants who were born in Finland with children of natives with a similar family background and neighbourhoods, no educational differences are observed. This is the outcome of Helsinki City Executive Office Special Researcher Laura Ansala's fresh article in urban research web magazine Kvartti.On average, the differences in education between immigrants’ children and children of natives are considerable in the Capital Region. “However, the educational attainment of immigrants’ children does vary a lot between children who have come to Finland at different ages and from different areas”, notes Researcher Laura Ansala in her article.“Another thing that should be considered in the comparison is the difference in the socio-economic status and neighbourhoods between families with an immigrant background and families with a Finnish background.”\\nThe picture of the educational attainment of immigrants’ children changes considerably, when they are compared to children of natives, who have been raised in similar families in terms of income, employment and household structure and in the same postal code areas. In the Capital Region, children of immigrants who are born in Finland are on average at least as likely to hold an upper secondary level degree by the age of 23 as children of natives growing up in similar families and neighbourhoods.\\nChildren’s\\nage at arrival affects educational attainmentHowever, children of immigrants who have arrived in Finland as children or teenagers are still less likely to hold an upper secondary level degree, when compared to children of immigrants who are born in Finland.“There are several factors that may contribute to this. For example, moving to Finland before the age critical to learning a language or the time spent in Finland by the parents could improve children’s educational attainment”, analyses Ansala.“Even though alternative explanations may not be ruled out entirely based on the analysis, the significance of the age of arrival is most likely explained by the time that the children spend in the Finnish society.”Hence, those children of immigrants who come to Finland during childhood could benefit from interventions that target their specific needs. The analysis of the Kvartti article is based on a study by Ansala et al. (2019), which examines the educational attainment and coping of immigrants’ children on the Finnish national level. The results concerning educational attainment from the Capital Region and entire Finland are qualitatively congruent with each other.Publications: Laura Ansala: Maahanmuuttajien lasten ja\\nsuomalaistaustaisten lasten välisiä kouluttautumiseroja selittävät saapumisikä,\\nperhetausta ja asuinalueet, Article in the Kvartti magazine, link to the article (in Finnish)\\nLaura Ansala, Ulla Hämäläinen & Matti Sarvimäki (2019).

Helsinki will host the meeting for the first time. About 500 participants from China and other parts of the world are expected to Finlandia Hall.Established in 2012 in Beijing, the aim of WTCF is to offer a platform for international tourism cooperation and sustainable development of tourism. Helsinki joined the WTCF network in 2014. Beijing and Helsinki have been sister cities since 2006.The annual meeting will get wide media exposure in China and hence it is an excellent opportunity to introduce Helsinki to Chinese tourists and to get insights into the Chinese tour operators’ views on where the tourism industry is evolving.“Helsinki is a pioneer of tourism from Asia and our cooperation with Chinese tourism industry players has attracted international attention. Acting as host for the WTCF network provides us with the opportunity to raise themes like responsibility and digitisation into the centre of the debate. Moreover, the meeting enables local tourism industry players to build relationships with Chinese players and to further develop what Helsinki has to offer as a tourist resort”, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The meeting brings a large number of high-ranking civil servants and key influencers and players of the tourism industry, including 18 Chinese tour operators, to Helsinki. About 20 Helsinkian tourism industry companies present their offerings to the tour operators at a workshop taking place at Finlandia Hall.The significance of cities is continuously growing also in tourism and therefore it is important for Helsinki to be part of this intercity network. Helsinki was confirmed as the host city of the WTCF annual meeting at the annual meeting that took place in Los Angeles on 19 September 2017, when also Tencent, a major Chinese company, and the City of Helsinki announced their partnership concerning the WeChat application. The new mini application, which is aimed at almost one billion WeChat users, is useful to e.g. tourists.“For Helsinki, the WTCF membership opened up new opportunities for cooperation in China. The WeChat partnership offers Helsinki a significant digital kick-off with respect to the development of services aimed at Chinese travellers. This has been noticed around the world as well, and there are people who keep a close eye on Helsinki’s moves”, asserts Helsinki Marketing CEO Laura Aalto.The City of Helsinki has partnered with Finnair, Finavia, Visit Finland, Tallink Silja, Visit Tallinn and Helsinki Distilling Company as co-arrangers of the WTCF annual meeting.One of the objectives of WTCF, besides promoting international cooperation within tourism, is to provide a platform for the sustainable development of tourism. The theme of the 2019 annual meeting is “Smart Tourism — Road to City Innovation and Development”. The programme of the meeting tackles, among other things, responsible tourism and technological innovations, trends in tourist flows globally, the importance of cultural values and tourism marketing.Helsinki, being a member of the network, plays an important role as a trendsetter. Helsinki and Lyon finished in a joint top spot in the EU’s new European Capital of Smart Tourism Competition 2019. Helsinki tourism has drawn up a plan of action that taps into the city’s status as European tourism capital this year, and Helsinki’s Roadmap for Tourism 2018–2021 will be complemented with a sustainable tourism programme, due for completion this year.In addition, the new Think Sustainably online service at MyHelsinki.fi assists people in finding more sustainable ways to live and have a good time in Helsinki. The version that was launched in June 2019 is a pilot that will be improved in future. The service is founded on criteria for increasingly responsible choices. These criteria, which are tailored-made for Helsinki, have been compiled jointly by the Demos Helsinki think-tank, local stakeholders and responsibility experts.The registered overnight stays of Chinese travellers at the accommodation businesses in Helsinki have more than doubled over the last five years. In the period between January and June this year there has been a growth of almost 2 per cent.The increase in the number of Chinese tourists has been supported by Finnair's strong Asia strategy, owing to which the air service between Helsinki and China is excellent.More informationWorld Tourism Cities FederationTencentMy Helsinki – Think Sustainably serviceHelsinki – European Capital of Smart Tourism 2019\", 'The Helsinki City Board decided at its meeting of 26 August to propose to the Uusimaa Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment that Helsinki should establish an expansion of the Maununneva nature reserve and confirm the area’s maintenance and operations plan.

Plans were also made for communal resident venues and the joint use of venues in various parts of the city.“The first season of participatory budgeting has been one of learning and experimenting new things, as always is the case when doing something for the first time. It has been inspiring to learn how committed people have been to the process”, says Kirsi Verkka, who is head of development.After the vote, the City will start implementing the ideas that were successful among the voters.

The campus will consist of a multiple sports training hall, a new apartment building to house students and the school building, which will be renovated and expanded. An expansion is proposed for the Mäkelänrinne Swimming Centre located at the campus.The new campus will give Mäkelänrinne students better conditions, as they will be able to train, study, have their meals and live in one place. Sports training will be supported with healthcare services, coaching and research. The Upper Secondary School expansion, the sports hall and Hoas student housing will be linked with indoor connections.The multiple sports hall will give 14,000 square metres of new training facilities to the Urhea Academy’s athletes and to local sports clubs. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Sports Academy Urhea has close to 5,000 member athletes.The Urhea hall will have a large general and weight training area, halls with mirrors, and halls for men’s and women’s gymnastics, track and field, judo and wrestling, rhythmic gymnastics and basketball.“In addition, we have plans for a physical therapy, rehabilitation and recovery centre, a sports healthcare and testing station, and office space. The campus will accommodate sports research through cooperation between the sports healthcare station Helsingin Urheilulääkäriasema and universities,” says Simo Tarvonen, CEO of Urhea-halli Oy.The Hoas student-housing apartment building at the campus will be the first student housing complex meant for athletes in Helsinki.

The festival guests got to follow several Yle live broadcasts, make weather forecasts, re-commentate classic sports moments and come up with ideas for a better Helsinki.According to the organisers, an estimated 25,000 people visited the event during the three days. The Helsinki Central Library Oodi’s visitor counter, located in the Pointti event area, registered more than 50,000 visitors during the event.— Pointti is a great addition to the event offerings of summery Helsinki. It attracted a vast number of visitors to the Kansalaistori Square, which is becoming a new kind of event centre in the City. Pointti inspired people of all ages to make and try different kinds of interesting things, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.The City of Helsinki participated in Pointti through a comprehensive programme. At the Kansalaistori Square, it was possible to try out diverse activities, from baby circus to night basketball. A Helsinki summer classic, playground meals, was also available for testing. At the Kotoklubi, everyday Finnish language was learned through play, activities and singing.The Pointti festival also celebrated the opening of the Sananvapauden aukio (Freedom of Speech Square). And the Helsinki Biennial pre-party when the marine ecological art workshop examined Baltic Sea water and algae with microscopes and painted sea organisms. The international contemporary art event Helsinki Biennial conquers Vallisaari for the first time in the summer of 2020.The urban festival’s programme included, e.g., live broadcasts of A-Studio and Villi Kortti, yoga sessions and ornament workshop according to Strömsö’s instructions. Yle Radio 1, Yle Radio Suomi, Yle Puhe and Yle Vega sent live broadcasts from the Oodi lobby during all three days. Pikku Kakkonen’s Adventure machine and Buu-klubben entertained the children. There is clear a demand for a new festival with interesting content.

Air pollutants and noise weaken living comfort and the quality of the living environment, and they cause health hazards.\\n  A wider use of non-studded winter tyres and road user charges for vehicles would significantly improve air quality and noise conditions in the city. Promotion of both measures is recorded in the City of Helsinki air quality plan and noise abatement action plan.Helsinki air quality weakened slightly in 2018 from the previous year. Some of the busy city-centre street canyons continued to exceed the annual nitrogen-oxide limit value due to vehicle exhaust emissions. However, average nitrogen oxide concentrations have been reduced, and the total length of street sections in which the annual limit value is exceeded has shortened.According to measurements conducted by Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY), concentrations of particulate matter in air have been reduced in Helsinki in recent years, which shows that the long-term development of street dust prevention and measures to reduce street dust have been effective. The EU limit value has not been exceeded at the HSY air quality monitoring stations since 2006. However, dust levels in the spring of 2018 exceeded the previous year’s levels due to weather conditions.“There is still danger that limit values of particles in air can be exceeded in inner-city street canyons and on busy roads, if we don’t focus intensely on street dust prevention each year,” points out Päivi\\nKippo-Edlund, Director of Environmental Protection at City of Helsinki.Street dust reaches high levels on many days every spring, as road and street surfaces dry and the flow of traffic releases materials accumulated on surfaces over winter months into air. Studies show that about half of street dust consists of material detached from asphalt surfaces by studded winter tyres. A wider use of non-studded winter tyres would both lower dust levels and reduce noise. The goal is to reduce the use of studded winter tyres to about one-third of all vehicles in the future.Each year some road and street sections are repaved with low-noise road surfaces. The use of such surfaces can significantly reduce the noise caused by road traffic at speeds that cause the most noise. Noise levels have been found to decrease by 2–4 decibels. Studded tyres cause more wear to low-noise road surfaces than non-studded tyres. As the surfaces wear, their noise abatement properties weaken. A wider use of non-studded winter tyres would significantly improve possibilities to use low-noise road surfaces.Road user charges for vehicles would reduce traffic volumes in the city, which would improve air quality and noise conditions.

The six-month robot bus experiment, under the several-year Helsinki RobobusLine project, stretches from May to November.The robot bus – an electric minibus – operates and carries passengers in regular traffic. Rides are free of charge to passengers during the experimental phase. The robot bus is operated by Rolan Oy, and the project is managed by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.The robot-bus shuttle in Kalasatama is in service on weekdays from 9:00 to 14:55, making three rounds in an hour. The three stops on the route are Redi, Polariksenkatu and Isoisänsilta. The minibus can take 8 passengers on board at a time. Some departures may, however, be cancelled. All disruptions and cancelled departures are announced in the Journey Planner.Robot buses are developed as a solution for the last-mile service, that is, taking riders from trunk line stops and public transport stations to stops near their homes and offices. On the Kalasatama robot bus line, this principle is put into practice for the first time in a highly urban testing environment. The experiment is also used to survey passengers on their user experience to explore the usability of robot buses.Robot bus experiments support Helsinki’s goal to render the city carbon neutral by 2035 by providing customers with carbon-free mobility alternatives.Read more:Line\\n26R in Journey Planner', 'Summer events in Kalasatama offer residents and visitors dance, contemporary circus and Baroque music.

The plants removed 97 percent of the phosphorous in wastewater. The Viikinmäki plant removed 91 percent and the Suomenoja plant 76 percent of the nitrogen in wastewater.The combined nutrient loading of the wastewater treatment plants to the Baltic Sea was 1,048 tonnes of nitrogen and 23 tonnes of phosphorous in 2018. Nitrogen loading to the sea was reduced by 6.4 percent from the previous year. Phosphorous loading was reduced from 31 tonnes to 23 tonnes, which is the all-time record.Both plants conduct their treated wastewater into the Baltic Sea. Thus continuous improvement in operations is tangible work to protect the Baltic Sea, seeking to minimize the loading caused by people and industry. “The year 2018 set a milestone at the Viikinmäki wastewater treatment plant, as the plant reached the record rate of 97 percent in electricity self-sufficiency. The plant’s 2018 electricity generation rate was the highest in the plant history, and the plant was fully energy self-sufficient from May onwards,” says Division Director Mari Heinonen at HSY.The increase in the plant’s energy self-sufficiency rate is a result of long-term efforts.

Mayor Jan Vapaavuori spoke to the UN on the occasion.The High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development – HLPF was held in New York on 9–19 July 2019. The UN’s most important conference on sustainable development, the HLPF, assesses global progress towards the goals stated in the Agenda 2030 action programme for sustainable development. Kicked off in 2015, the Agenda 2030 action programme aims at eradication of extreme poverty and at sustainable development taking environment, economy and people equally into account. In September 2018, Helsinki voluntarily committed itself to reporting to the UN about its own implementation of the sustainable development goals, as the second city in the world, second only to New York. The report “From Agenda to Action – The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019” was completed in June 2019. The findings of the report show that the goals in Helsinki’s latest City Strategy match the UN sustainable development goals very well. Furthermore, Helsinki has already carried out or is in the process of carrying out many measures that promote the UN goals. The findings of the report will also be used to support the planning of the city’s actions in future.Mayor Vapaavuori made his address at a session around the theme of developing the role of the High Level Political Forum so as to make it an even more efficient monitor of Agenda 2030 implementation when the first four-year cycle ends. In addition, Mayor Vapaavuori spoke at four related events, one of which is organised by the City of Helsinki together with the City of New York and the Permanent Mission of Finland to the UN. Helsinki and New York have been cooperating closely throughout the process, and they encourage other cities to engage into voluntary implementation reporting.“The influence of cities in the world is constantly growing, owing to factors such as urbanisation and the urban nature of global challenges. Cities are increasingly joining ranks with states to solve global problems. The most important, concrete work with Agenda 2030 is done at local level - near people. Helsinki actively cooperates with other cities to ensure that the role of cities as influencers is acknowledged in key international forums and networks. In future, an important forum for cooperation between states and cities could be the implementation of the UN goals for sustainable development”, Mayor Vapaavuori concludes.Themes emphasised by Finland in the forum included education, competence and future-skills, and their links to sustainable development. The delegation, headed by Minister of Education Li Andersson, included representatives of the City of Helsinki, several ministries, the local Agenda 2030 youth organisation as well as civic organisations and business. During the forum, Finland hosted two related events and organises, in its fresh capacity of President of the Council of the European Union, and together with the EU, the first event within the UN framework that presents the EU’s work on the Agenda 2030.Jan Vapaavuori: the 2019 HLPF summit (pdf)Helsinki and the sustainable development goalsFrom Agenda to Action – The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019', 'There will be delays to traffic in the capital region, in particular in Helsinki and Vantaa, from Wednesday 17 July to Friday 19 July due to an informal meeting of EU Home Affairs and Justice Ministers.\\xa0\\n\\n  The biggest delays are expected on Tuusulanväylä, Ring Road I, Hämeenlinnanväylä and Mannerheimintie in both directions on all three days.

The all-day event welcomed thousands of visitors from Finland and abroad. All happenings and components of the festival echoed sustainability, which is an important theme for Finland during the presidency.Sustainability was reflected by the programme and sites, including a Youth Eco-café, a hobbyhorse workshop with hobbyhorse materials provided by Helsinki Metropolitan Area Reuse Centre (Pääkaupunkiseudun kierrätyskeskus), and biodegradable face glitter paints at the EU tent.The programme was received with enthusiasm, and the atmosphere was joyous. Some workshops were so popular that the organizers ran out of materials. “We had to fetch more materials for the hobbyhorse workshop in the middle of the day. Many old woolen socks and floorball sticks got new lives,” commented the producers of the park festival\\xa0Hanna Iiskola and Hanna-Mari Ukkonen.The strongest messages about sustainability were delivered through the artwork Plastic Mama. The 30-metre-wide artwork created from recycled plastics was artist Kaisa Salmi’s statement about the state of the Earth. The artist addressed the audience from the top of the artwork for 10 hours.The Finnish Presidency opening festival also marked the launch of a Töölönlahti sports project, which challenges everybody to move around the Earth for the good of the Baltic Sea. “The sports project extends through the Finnish Presidency period. Helsinki invites every resident, visitor and meeting guest to tour the Töölönlahti area, accumulating kilometres on a joint tour around the Earth. If and when we log enough kilometres to circle the Earth, about 40,000 kilometres, the City of Helsinki will donate the funds originally earmarked for gifts to meeting participants, a total of 50,000 euros, to Baltic Sea protection,” affirmed Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori in his opening speech. The Töölönlahti area was put to use as a festival site to an unprecedented extent. The festival site stretched from the Kansalaistori square to the shores of the Töölö bay. The area served the purpose well, and the many event booths and locations including daytime dance grounds and children’s venues had plenty of space in the park. For the first time, the international youth football tournament Helsinki Cup brought its games to the heart of the city. Prime Minister Antti Rinne and Mayor Vapaavuori kicked off Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union together with Helsinki Cup players.

The pilots have developed and expanded year by year. This year, you can get on a self-driving bus in living lab district Kalasatama and on a record-long 2.5 km route in the most eastern district Vuosaari. Congested streets full of passenger cars are a challenge for growing cities around the world. Also Helsinki is looking for means to decrease traffic congestion as well as emissions and other climate impacts caused by motor vehicles. A key means to influence this is investment in public transportation, but its proportion of traffic has remained almost the same in recent years. However, self-driving robot buses could increase the popularity and efficiency of public transportation in the future. This is why Helsinki has been testing them for several years. ‘The aim is to use the pilots to learn as much as possible about robot buses even in the early stages of technological development, such as how residents receive them, how they function as a part of public transportation and what they can offer to the mobility of citizens,’ says Jari Honkonen, Project manager at the City of Helsinki’s innovation company Forum Virium Helsinki. Robot buses can change public transportation significantlyHelsinki is committed to become carbon neutral by 2035 and, in line with this, recognises that problems associated to traffic and transport need to be tackled. Therefore, the city has laid down in its official strategy to act as a testbed and to promote new mobility technologies - of which automated demand-driven shuttle buses are a notable example. By offering residents an emission-free transportation option, robot buses support Helsinki’s goals of carbon neutrality. “If the robot bus technology develops as expected, they can develop public transportation in a more cost-efficient direction and enhance service levels by expanding its coverage to areas where the lines do not currently reach, making departures more frequent and public transportation more reachable”, Jari Honkonen says.There is still much to be tested around self-driving buses, so the pilots will continue for the years to come, ultimately contributing to making Helsinki the most functional smart city of the world.Read more:Forum Virium', \"The public park party in the Töölönlahti Park and on the Kansalaistori Square mark the opening of Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 8 July. The summer day’s programme is abundant and its main theme is sustainability. The opening event is also the kick-off for the Töölönlahti Bay activity event, where the participants walk, jog or run together around the world in 180 days for the Baltic Sea. The participants wake up to the festive summer day in the Töölönlahti Park at nine o'clock with morning workout backed by live music. The pace slowly increases towards the official opening of the summer festival at 1 pm, when Prime Minister Antti Rinne and Mayor of Helsinki Jan Vapaavuori inaugurate the party together with the children of Helsinki Cup. The programme continues through the day. The day will hold a rock’n’roll workout with the Finnish band Waltari, brushing up dance moves at traditional partner dances, a sweat-inducing beach sauna or enjoyment at a park picnic. There will also be a number of summer activities for the children: A gig by children's band Pikku Papun Orkesteri, a hobby horse track and different kinds of workshops. The evening culminates in the opening of the Helsinki Cup, when thousands of junior footballers from 21 countries gather to take the match oath. Games played by the youngest juniors can be watched next to the Finlandia Hall from the early morning.Sustainability the theme at the Kansalaistori SquareAmong the themes of the presidency, Finland has chosen to highlight climate change as an important part of the opening celebrations.

The Töölönlahti round is 2.2 kilometres and the earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 kilometres, or 18,182 times the circumference of the Töölönlahti Bay.

The ranking is Helsinki’s best ever in this index, which is produced by the\\n  Copenhagenize Design Co. planning and design agency once in every two years. Helsinki ranked 18th in the 2017 index.Copenhagenize’s assessment acknowledges Helsinki’s ambitious goals for cycling, plans for an extensive cycling route network and the construction of new routes.Reetta Keisanen, Cycling Coordinator at City of Helsinki, is delighted with the award.“The construction of state-of-the-art cycling routes in Helsinki is a result of work carried out over several years. It’s magnificent that our work wins an international award. It tells us that we’re on the right course, and we’ll continue our efforts so we’ll climb on the index step by step,” Keisanen says.Helsinki also received recommendations for further development. Despite the progress, the implementation of the Helsinki cycling route network and its funding should be accelerated. Other drawbacks in Helsinki according to the assessment include the closure of the bike-share system for the winter season and lack of government inputs in the funding of cycling routes.“Next we’ll focus on the said drawbacks to accelerate the implementation of the cycling route network and to improve the quality of the network,” Keisanen continues.Other awarded cities set good examples for Helsinki, such as Oslo, which resembles Helsinki in terms of cycling conditions. Oslo rose by several ranks in the index. The city has hired 20 persons to promote cycling.In addition, top-ranking Copenhagen now serves as a model for Helsinki, as the city is a mentor for Helsinki in the EU-funded HANDSHAKE project. Cities collaborate in this project to develop cycling solutions.Helsinki – as other cities worldwide – develop cycling as a means to create a safer, more enjoyable and more functional city. The more people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport rather than drive, increasing numbers of people can move smoothly in the city.Helsinki was presented the award at the annual Velo-City cycling conference. The award was received by Reetta Keisanen and key persons who have developed cycling solutions in Helsinki, including representatives of the City of Helsinki Urban Environment Division, Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), Helsinki City Transport (HKL), consultancies and the cycling network Pyöräilykuntien verkosto.Read more:Copenhagenize index 2019', 'A year ago, Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori launched the idea of a brainstorming platform for all Helsinkians, which would be carried out through the Most Functional City in the World website.The Most Functional City in the World website was open during the beginning of the year and more than 400 ideas were submitted. A working group of city experts went through the proposals and made a pre-selection– The experiment was pleasant and there was an abundance of ideas. In the service, we were especially looking for neat improvements to everyday life and there were plenty of such ideas. We have good feedback channels for reporting different kinds of flaws, but coming up with new ideas is worth encouraging as well, says Vapaavuori. In June, it was two years since Jan Vapaavuori started as Mayor of Helsinki. – Helsinki is a positively active city, whose residents like to engage in the brainstorming of new events and participate in the development of the City. This is a great resource. Helsinki becomes more enjoyable and the world’s most functional city only together with the citizens, says Vapaavuori.A more\\nservice-minded and active Helsinki wanted by manyMany good ideas were concerned with a more service-minded Helsinki.

The City’s new digitalisation programme with its executive groups is solving these challenges. Other popular ideas were the ones aimed at making the urban space more pleasant and active. Other wishes included livelier market squares, more litter bins in the entire City and higher park benches. The signage and the removal of high setts and especially the winter maintenance of pedestrian routes gained a lot of support.

Their statements dealt with the prevention of young people’s social exclusion and loneliness, support for leisure activities of children and youth, and public spaces.The results of the experiment were evaluated at a meeting of elected officials and young people on 11 June. Youth Council representatives in the experiment were acknowledged for their preparedness for committee meetings, their familiarity with meeting agendas and to-the-point statements. Youth Council representatives expressed their gratitude for the trust bestowed in them and a wish that youth representation at committee meetings should be continued as a regular activity.The results of the experiment were evaluated with an online survey taken by 45 persons. 90 percent of young people considered the experiment to be highly successful. 82 percent of elected officials and 95 percent of City representatives considered the experiment to be either highly successful or fairly successful.No survey respondent considered the outcome of the Youth Council attendance at committee meetings to be fairly poor or very poor. Areas for improvement suggested included familiarization of young people and various representation models. Furthermore, it was suggested that young people and the Youth Council could impact decisions more efficiently if they were heard earlier in the decision-making process, that is, at the decision-preparation stage.Pictured above are the Helsinki Youth Council representatives who attended division committee meetings: (from left) Elo Umukoro, Jim Koskinen, Tilda Lassila, Sigrid Autio, Vivian Ljungqvist, Alma Rantalaiho and Dan Cederlöf.

The tea pavilion opens on 3rd July and stays open until the end of the Helsinki Design Week on 15th September. During this time anyone can come to the pavilion to drink tea and eat snacks.With the tea pavilion project, the Finnish Institute in London wants to support the principles of sustainable development and at the same time, it creates international networks.The tea pavilion celebrates the anniversary of diplomatic relationship between Finland and Great Britain. In May it was a hundred years since Britain acknowledged the independence of Finland. The Finnish architect Sami Rintala, who specializes in wood construction, guides the students’ work. In practice the pavilion is produced in two countries: the bigger parts are made in Wood Studio at Aalto University and the smaller and lighter parts in London, from where they then travel with the students to Helsinki.— Finally, the students meet at the building plot and construct the pavilion. How does the end result then look like in real size? How does it feel to step inside for the first time? How does English tea taste like in a park in Helsinki? Soon we will find out, says Rintala.Tea and snacks can be bought from the cafeteria at the Design Museum during its opening hours and brought to the site. Additionally, it is possible to bring own snacks to the pavilion around the clock.', 'Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, which starts today, will bring Helsinki a lot of international visibility.

Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies and former mayor of New York City, in London on 25 June 2019.All 28 European capital cities have been invited to join the project. Through project support, grants, and professional development programming for Chief Digital Officers and other key leaders, Bloomberg Philanthropies aims to help European cities to consolidate digital leadership and to share lessons learned with cities across the rest of the world.\\n“A critical part of the Helsinki City Strategy is our commitment to making better sense of global change. Helsinki aims to be the city in the world that makes the best use of digitalization. Our collaboration with Michael R. Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies enables Helsinki to succeed in these critical issues and to work with other cities in concrete ways,” says Helsinki Mayor Jan\\nVapaavuori.Cities participating in the initiative will benefit from a range of supports to advance local efforts. Chief Innovation, Digital, Data, and Information Officers who are driving these efforts will receive leadership support focused on building strong teams and managing transformational change. Cities will be eligible for innovation grants and project support, delivered by world-class partners to help transform critical public services. In addition, cities will benefit from best practice sharing and peer-to-peer networking.“The City of Helsinki has an ambitious digitalization strategy aimed at creating better digital services for citizens. A requirement for the creation of new proactive and customized services is ethical use of data and AI,” says Mikko Rusama, Chief Digital Officer at City of Helsinki.“We look forward to deepening cooperation with Bloomberg Philanthropies and with leading smart cities such as London.

According to the annual congress city statistics published by the Union of International Associations (UIA) this week, Helsinki is the most popular Nordic city for organising congresses.Helsinki improved its position in the overall rankings to 14th, leaving behind it such cities as Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo. Last year, Helsinki hosted a total of 329 international association meetings. Work-related travel accounted for around a half of all visits to Helsinki, and a total of 4.17 million overnight stays were registered in Helsinki in 2018.Helsinki is known as a reliable and functional congress city. Helsinki’s advantages include its efficient services and cooperation with local event organisers. “This is the result of close collaboration and a fine achievement for the entire industry. Helsinki is the world’s most functional city, also for congress organisers,” comments Leena Lassila, Director, Global Sales, at Helsinki Marketing.Helsinki expects another busy year in 2019. Already three major international events have been organised in Helsinki at the start of the summer: the 29th Annual Meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC Europe – 2000 delegates), the World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF – 1500 delegates) and the European Conference of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS & Health 2.0 – 3000 delegates). The peak season this year, however, is expected in the autumn. For example, Europe's largest international higher education conference, the 31st Annual EAIE Conference and Exhibition, will be held in Helsinki in September and is expected to attract an estimated 6000 delegates.Congress activities in line with sustainable developmentHelsinki is also a leader in the congress sector in terms of sustainable development. Each year, the Global Destination Sustainability (GDS) Index ranks congress destinations on the basis of their environmental deeds and social responsibility, as well as the commitment of service providers and the activities of convention bureaus – i.e. Helsinki Marketing’s Congress Bureau – from the perspective of sustainability. The purpose is to promote awareness of sustainable solutions among congress actors.Helsinki ranked 5th in the GDS Index in 2018 and 6th in 2017. Responsibility is of growing importance among event organisers. “This year we are piloting a responsible congress organisation model that offers event organisers easy-to-use tools to organising even more responsible events,” Lassila explains.Congresses are a significant source of income for Helsinki’s tourism industryCongresses help enhance awareness and appeal for the host city. Helsinki’s advantages include not only a reliable reputation, the high quality of services, excellent connections and safety, but also the high standard of research in many scientific fields. Helsinki aims to attract a growing number of international association meetings, business conferences and related events. Helsinki’s position as a centre of leading expertise supports this aim.Attracting major events to the city requires long-term work, but the rewards in terms of income are significant. The average congress visitor generates up to five times more tourism income than the average tourist. Congress visitors also stay in Helsinki for more nights, and many choose Helsinki as a future holiday destination.Helsinki’s appeal as a congress city is also growing due to increased accommodation capacity. The Helsinki metropolitan area currently has approximately 19,000 rooms, and at least 5000 more rooms are expected in the near future. “Even though our accommodation capacity is quite a lot smaller than the other Nordic capitals, we are still the number one congress city in the Nordics,” Lassila points out.\", \"The phone messages at health stations in Helsinki have been renewed because of feedback from customers.

The project, named “Citizen Trust Through AI Transparency”, will provide internationally adoptable guidelines on how to inform about public sector use of personal data and AI to the citizens.The project participants are City of Espoo, City of Helsinki, Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland), Finland’s Ministry of Justice, The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra and Saidot (AI transparency software development company). They will together:Maintaining trust between citizens and administrationTransparency of citizen data usage and algorithmic decision-making is a widely recognised global challenge. AI systems and algorithmic decision-making are increasingly used in public administration to service citizens in their various life-events, however, people do not have access to sufficient information about what, by whom and how these decisions are being made. Hence, by offering standardised information and communication guidelines on personal data usage, AI systems and algorithmic decision-making, the project wishes to maintain trust between citizens and cities & governments.\\nThe participant organisations’ expertise and interaction with citizens will be utilised to combine the regulatory, technological, ethical and citizen perspectives for a recommendation on shared practice. Real-life use cases and citizen feedback will be used to understand the future needs and current knowledge levels on the use of AI in the public sector. Citizen engagement is imperative for the project, hence people will be involved via interviews and workshops. ”We want to openly communicate to the citizens how and\\nfor what purposes their information is being used, and what are the decisions\\nthat impact their lives based on. This information must be easily accessible\\nand relevant information for the residents must be communicated in a clear and\\nunderstandable manner”, says City of Espoo’s Data-Analytics Consultant, Tomas Lehtinen.\"In\\nHelsinki, we discuss widely the use of AI, and the ethics of it.

The companies themselves benefit from it as well, because, according to the study, shorter distances further the networking that occurs through the employee mobility between companies. Other organisational forms of proximity, such as the educational background of the personnel at the companies, are also connected to it. This is according to a fresh study published by the Helsinki City Executive Office. In the Helsinki-Uusimaa Region, the functionality of the labour market and the networking of the companies can be furthered by creating land-use related prerequisites for geographic proximity. This can be achieved by developing especially the business clusters and well accessible areas in the region.Proximity furthers networks in smaller\\nclusters as well in the entire Helsinki-Uusimaa RegionAgglomerations benefit companies in many ways: shorter distances increase the employee mobility between the business establishments, as the transfers of employees from one organisation to another are more likely to occur between business establishments that are geographically closer to each other. With the employees, knowledge and networks are also transferred across the borders.According to the results of the study, companies in knowledge-intensive industries benefit from shorter distances in all areas of the Helsinki-Uusimaa region. This occurs in both dense business clusters and in less dense areas, where the business establishments are geographically further away from each other on average. This is relevant for the future growth outlook of the area, as the significance of knowledge in the production processes is constantly growing.The growth of the strongest business clusters into increasingly dense, diverse and functional business areas should thus be supported. It is essential to enable complementary construction and renovation of old constructions, to make sure that the supply of premises can adapt to the changing demand in attractive areas. When the operating conditions of companies in the Helsinki-Uusimaa region are developed, it is integral to make use of the opportunities presented by the rail traffic services and the well accessible station and stop surroundings.\\nThe Helsinki City Executive Office’s fresh study analyses how geographic proximity is linked to employee mobility between business establishments in knowledge-intensive industries in the Helsinki-Uusimaa region, and how the significance of the proximity varies between different types of areas in the region. This study has been compiled as part of the ROBUST project for the research and development of modes and administrative models for interregional interaction in Europe. The research material has been compiled by connecting geographic location data of business establishments in knowledge-intensive industries with data from Statistics Finland’s registers concerning business establishments and their personnel.\\nPublication:Tamás Lahdelma:\\xa0\\n  Job-switching\\npatterns in knowledge-intensive industries within the Helsinki-Uusimaa Region, Helsinki City Executive Office, Working Papers 2019:1,\\xa0PDF publication,\\xa0summary in a nutshell (in Finnish).', 'A new solar power plant of Helsinki City Transport (HKL) generates an equal amount of electricity that would power more than 200 apartment building units for a year. The power plant enables HKL to reduce its carbon footprint.HKL commissioned its solar power plant on 18 June 2019. The plant is located at the Roihupelto Metro depot. It powers the depot and so reduces HKL’s carbon footprint. All electricity consumed by HKL rail transport services is already carbon-free, being produced with Nordic wind and hydro power.“In-house solar power generation is part of HKL’s responsibility. We seek to be pioneers in distributed renewable energy generation, and the Metro depot power plant allows us to assess our larger potential for in-house generation of renewable energy,” says Maija Sarpo, Head of Quality and Environmental Management at HKL.According to an unofficial listing, the HKL plant is Finland’s 11th biggest solar power plant and, as such, it is among Finland’s 20 biggest solar power plants to date. The power plant is Finland’s 9th biggest rooftop solar power plant.\\xa0\\xa0“The Roihupelto Metro depot’s annual power consumption is about 4,600 MWh. The new power plant generates 422 MWh of solar power in a year, so it covers close to 10 percent of the depot’s power consumption. If the solar power plant’s generation should momentarily exceed the depot’s consumption, the extra power could be directed to Metro train operation in HKL’s own electricity grid,” says HKL Project Manager Lasse\\nRosenholm, responsible for the power plant implementation.The new solar power plant consists of 1,780 polycrystalline solar panels and 5 solar inverters. Solar inverters convert the direct current (DC) output of solar panels into alternating current for the property’s electrical network.“A special feature of the solar power plant is that panels face three directions – east, south and west. This enables the plant to generate more evenly from sunrise to sunset. The plant has extensive smart features, allowing us to monitor output down to the level of single panels. The GEF Vision™ application allows us to diagnose the operation of the inverters and the whole plant remotely,” says Juha Huttunen, a technical specialist for GreenEnergy Finland Oy.The design life of the solar power plant is 30 years or more and could be extended with updates.', 'Pride Helsinki 2019 takes hold of the city on 24–30 June. The City of Helsinki also works to advance equality and non-discrimination for the benefit of its citizens and employees. The Culture and Leisure Division offers a breath-taking variety of events and happenings during the festival week.Helsinki Pride is the major cultural and human rights event for sexual and gender minorities in Finland. The Pride week is full of programmes, such as lectures and debates, workshops, art and culture besides many parties. The event is arranged by the human rights organisation Helsinki Pride community. The climax of the week will be the parade and the park party on Saturday 29 June. The police estimate that about 100,000 people took part in the Pride Parade last year. According to the city strategy, Helsinki is a strong, vibrant and multicultural promoter of liberal democracy and tolerance. A growing Helsinki fosters a culture permitting pluralism and enabling encounters between population groups. ‘Above all, Helsinki is a community. Each Helsinkian is an equal and equally valuable member of this community without regard to background, views, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation. A city where equality prevails is a place where people want to live, start companies, work, learn, play, go to their jobs and raise their families. Every day, Helsinki works to this end. Helsinki Pride on its part is doing important work to advance equality in Helsinki – and is also celebrating what has already been achieved’, says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Active equality and non-discrimination work in HelsinkiThe City of Helsinki has a long tradition in promoting gender equality, the City has, for instance, had a gender equality committee with elected officials since the mid-1980s. At the same time, it is recognised that fruitful equality and non-discrimination work requires constant development efforts and new initiatives. In the planning period 2019–2021, among these are the systematic development of gender impact assessment as well as better considering gender diversity in the municipal services and activities. A future objective is to develop the equality and non-discrimination work as a more concise unity for promoting human rights in the services. The personnel gender equality plan was drawn up to guarantee that representatives of all genders are treated equally well in all workplaces of the City of Helsinki. In its capacity as employer, the City expects a business-like and appreciative attitude towards all co-workers and all customers. The measures of the personnel gender equality plan will be updated two years from now. The annual measures of the personnel non-discrimination plan will be updated during this year.In order to promote consistent human rights work, the City of Helsinki set up a human rights network in early 2019. It has been joined by more than 180 members of the municipal staff – from traffic warden to city architect, from information officer to practical nurse, and it meets regularly to come up with ideas and to develop municipal services from the point of view of equality. Earlier this year, Helsinki for the first time asked the city residents how well the city has managed to realise equality and non-discrimination. More than 500 replies were received. They contained valuable information that will contribute to the advancement of equality and the improvement of municipal services. The Culture and Leisure Division offers a breath-taking variety of events during the theme weekDuring Helsinki Pride 2019 festival week, the City of Helsinki will organise events that take place at cultural centres, museums and youth centres. At the museums, there will be e.g. guided tours on the queerness theme as well as singalongs.

The city of Helsinki has set an aim to reduce emissions by 60 percent by the year 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2035. This shift requires both major structural changes and everyday actions. Individual choices matter – in order to stop further climate warming, every Finn should reduce their carbon footprint from 10.3 tonnes to 2.5 tonnes by the year 2030.The Think Sustainably service helps to choose more sustainable ways of living in Helsinki and enjoying the city. It filters content from the MyHelsinki.fi website to suggest sustainable services, such as restaurants, shops, sights, events and accommodation.The version launched in June 2019 is a pilot service and it involves a limited number of operators. It will be further developed to include sustainable choices from restaurants to mobility.The base of the service is in tailor-made criteria for the city of Helsinki that have been developed together with the independent think tank Demos Helsinki, along with local interest groups and sustainability experts. The criteria highlight ecological sustainability and specifically address climate change while also considering social sustainability. The purpose of the criteria is to filter out service providers working in a sustainable manner and to encourage operators to develop their function further.Service providers are responsible for evaluating their own services in terms of meeting the criteria in their respective service category. If a service provider meets the minimum requirements in their category, it can then be classified as a sustainable choice on the MyHelsinki portal. The service providers who have met the required criteria are marked with a green tab and website visitors can examine more in-depth which criteria were fulfilled and which not. The purpose is not to pinpoint who are the straight-A students, but rather to encourage different operators to find an impressive array of solutions that encourage customers and visitors to engage in more sustainable lifestyles. The process of developing the service included researching the most significant factors of ecological sustainability related to different service categories. These dealt mostly with greenhouse emissions caused by energy production and the impacts of mobility and food. In addition, waste management, factors related to circular economy, protecting biodiversity, accessibility, employment and preventing discrimination were considered. The criteria, though only in its pilot phase, has already encouraged several service providers to make changes such as switching energy and heating contracts to environmentally friendlier ones.The aim of the criteria was also to be accessible to many different types of service providers because everyone should have the opportunity to be part of a bigger wave of change. True impact is brought about when a large and diverse group participates in it each through their own actions.Customers and visitors can give feedback on the success of the provider through the same website.Read more on MyHelsinki.fi\\xa0', 'Helsinki Pride Week is an annual human rights and cultural event.

The concept for the New Central Library Oodi was created from a user perspective, by means of design. (Photo: Tuomas Uusheimo)\\n\\nHelsinki has brought up design competence strongly as a part of the City’s development, international profile and competitiveness. At the same time, the City has profiled itself as a pioneer in expanding the significance of design. Helsinki has initiated a collaboration with the Aalto University’s Department of Design in order to profoundly evaluate the impact of design in the development of the City. The objective is to produce a review of the different contexts in which design is used in the operations of the City. Another goal is to increase the understanding of how different kinds of design projects can be structured and how the results and learnings of them can be made more visible. The first outcome of the project will be a city design map with descriptions of different project types and their characteristics.“Design has made Helsinki into an interesting role model on the world stage. Helsinki is perceived as a city that knows and understands how to make use of design. The city employs a growing number of service designers and development work is also carried out jointly with design agencies”, says City Design Manager Päivi Hietanen.Helsinki has more than ten years of experience of utilising design widely in its development activities. To the City, design means human-centred activities, that the citizen perspective is considered in all aspects of service development. Design has also been recognised in the City Strategy as a significant tool for transformation and profiling.“Helsinki aims to make the City better and more functional every day. In order to share the best practices, it is essential to highlight new actions and their impact. Here, the evaluation work performed with top researchers in the field plays an important part”, describes Hietanen.At the same time, the evaluation is work that supports the learning of the City’s developers.“In this way, we create prerequisites for work that is even more impactful. In the background, there was also a need to make a more systematic evaluation of the results gained through design and the organisation's ability and maturity to make use of design”, notes Development Consultant Meri Virta at the Helsinki City Executive Office.\\nOne fresh example of service design is the co-design event between the Liikkuvat network and senior citizens, which was arranged at Oodi this spring. The objective was to find new ideas for increasing everyday physical activities among senior citizens.Aalto University’s Department of Design has collaborated with Helsinki for more than ten years, especially when it comes to questions related to participatory planning and service design. The co-operation has resulted in several publications and theses. At the same time, the utilisation of service design has expanded in Helsinki and the competence has developed rapidly.“The City of Helsinki has been an international forerunner in the utilisation of service design. The extent and number of different kinds of projects is considerable. The typification of these and the reviewing of the challenges is extremely interesting in terms of both organisational learning and academic research”, says Professor Tuuli Mattelmäki, Head of the Department of Design at Aalto University.The report of the first phase of joint development project will be published in October.

In September 2018, the city, being after New York the second city in the world and the first one in Europe to do so, thus made a commitment to report voluntarily to the UN on its implementation of the sustainable development goals. Helsinki has completed its report, called From Agenda to Action – The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019, and it will be handed over to the UN in July.In 2015, the UN member states came to an agreement on the sustainable development goals and the action plan. The Agenda 2030 action plan is universal and aims at eradicating extreme poverty and advancing sustainable development that equally takes the environment, the economy and people into account. There are in sum 17 sustainable development goals (SDG), and annually a UN high-level political forum specifies the areas of focus whose advancement is the topic of reporting. In 2019, the areas of focus are quality education (SDG4), decent work and economic growth (SDG8), reduction of inequality (SDG10), climate action (SDG13), peace, justice and accountable administration (SDG16), and cooperation and partnership (SDG17).“Cities are gaining in importance globally and the objective is to view cities as strategic partners – not only as implementers of the agenda – at all fora where global problems are being solved. The sustainable development goals constitute the universal terms of reference on the basis of which various parties can contribute to this discourse on an equal basis”, says Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.A significant part of the actual implementation of the sustainable development goals take place locally. The cities have a substantial role in achieving the goals. The New York model for local reporting highlights the role of cities both vis-à-vis the city residents and the global community.The objective of the report has been to generate knowledge about the implementation of sustainable development in Helsinki. The commitment to the process of reporting has enabled Helsinki at the midpoint of the term of its city strategy 2017–2021 to assess how well the strategic goals serve the UN’s sustainable development goals.The process of reporting has also been a means to promote cooperation with the international community, to make other cities commit to assessing and reporting their sustainable development and to influence matters in order to boost the input of cities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals globally. Helsinki cooperated closely with New York City in the course of the entire process.Moreover, a close relationship between the government and the city is a key part of being able to fulfil the sustainable development goals successfully.\\xa0The Helsinki report, From Agenda to Action – The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019, comes to the conclusion that Helsinki's city strategy is ambitious and wide-ranging and that its goals fit well in with the UN goals for sustainable development. The report manages to illustrate that Helsinki already has carried out or is in the process of carrying out many measures that advance the UN goals at the city level. No substantial deficiencies or gaps in the implementation of the sustainable development areas of focus were found.Even though the report’s approach is strategically comprehensive, it nevertheless does not cover the entire range of municipal services or operations. The city promotes the realisation of the UN goals also in many other ways in addition to those that have been given attention in this report. The report states too that it is necessary to develop and improve indicators for the follow-up of the UN goals in connection with possible further reports. As for the follow-up indicators, the challenge is to produce indicators that are comparable. It would also be advantageous to analyse in more detail the points of convergence between on the one hand the targets in connection with the sustainable development goals, and on the other hand the local level activities.In accordance with the results of the report and the questions that have been raised in the wake of the reporting process, the city will develop the deployment of the city strategy in order to realise the sustainable development goals in the municipal organisation as well as possible. The more conscious people are about advancing sustainable development in the tasks they are fulfilling, the more likely it is that they will succeed.Moreover, the city actively communicates the results to its residents and stakeholders to raise consciousness of the importance of the sustainable development goals in the city’s day-to-day operations.Helsinki will also carry on being an active international influencer with the aim to persuade other cities to commit themselves to issuing voluntary implementation reports. Jointly with other cities, Helsinki endeavours to influence matters to achieve recognition for the importance of cities in key international fora and networks – and in the UN in particular – and to enable cities to participate in drawing up the agenda and the goals too in the future – and not just in their implementation. Helsinki also actively advances global awareness of the sustainable development goals.From Agenda to Action – The Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Helsinki 2019\\xa0 PDFMore information on sustainable development in Helsinki\", 'The C21 Mayors of Finland consider that the implementation of the Government Programme requires a close partnership between the Government and the biggest cities of the country.\\xa0The programme of Prime Minister Antti Rinne’s Government includes many items that can have significant impacts depending on the manner in which those items would be implemented – impacts on the dynamism of cities, the growth opportunities of cities, securing sustainable growth and the organization of services and transport. It is necessary that, as the Government implements the programme, that the Government should do so in close interaction with the country’s biggest cities.\\xa0The success of the entire country is more than before dependent on how comprehensively the biggest cities can tackle complex challenges ranging from segregation to climate change. It should be a core task of urban policies to ensure that cities have tools to tackle those challenges. This requires a partnership approach and an inclusion of a city policy perspective in all the biggest projects and actions of the Government. Cities cannot be mere objects in the implementation of policies.\\xa0From the point of view of the C21 network, the Government Programme has both good and worrying elements. Positive elements include the programme’s clauses on housing policy and increased contractual cooperation between cities and the Government. Cities are prepared to support the achievement of these goals with their activities. Furthermore, the role of municipalities must be strengthened in the organization of employment services, as stated in the Government Programme. Cities have all the means and the readiness to carry out this task.\\xa0On a general level, the Government Programme recognizes differences between cities, although concrete measures are lacking. The Government should customize its range of means in urban policies taking into consideration the special needs of cities. This can be accomplished only with city-oriented urban policies, by making use of the expertise of cities and by readjusting the State-oriented angle of approach towards considering how the Government should support and enable cities’ own development work and activities.\\xa0The biggest concerns of the Mayors are related to the sustainability of the municipal economy and the reform of social welfare and healthcare. The Government Programme includes many policies concerning increases in or expansion of the tasks and responsibilities of municipalities. These policies would entail considerable costs for municipalities, which would have to be compensated for in their entirety. It is also important that all measures and reforms of the Government Programme should be implemented in an economically sustainable manner and with regard to the municipal economy.\\xa0In terms of the reform of social welfare and healthcare, the Mayors are concerned that the model proposed by the Government would not solve the key problems of social welfare and healthcare. Most importantly, the reform should focus on the key elements, that is, services and the development of services from the customer point of view. A reform carried out on the municipal basis would be a more controlled and secure manner of reform than the region-based approach and, combined with stronger regulatory control than at present, it would produce results fast in terms of services. The best and customer-oriented solutions do not require the establishment of a new administrative level, and the problems with services are not solved by establishing regions with multiple responsibilities or by introducing a regional tax.\\xa0The Mayors of C21 cities state that, despite the objectives recorded in the Government Programme, some of them good, to strengthen the abilities of cities to function, the reform of social welfare and healthcare, carried out in the manner proposed by the Government, would diminish the abilities and resources of cities to serve as regional, as local and thus as national engines of growth and their abilities to sustain growth and development.\\xa0The network of the C21 Mayors comprise the Mayors of Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Oulu, Turku, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Kuopio, Kouvola, Pori, Joensuu, Lappeenranta, Hämeenlinna, Vaasa, Rovaniemi, Seinäjoki, Mikkeli, Kotka, Salo and Porvoo.

The selection of Helsinki – for the first time ever – for this international gathering of specialists and visionaries in the future of health is in itself proof of Helsinki’s strengths in health innovations. Those strengths form key elements of the future of healthcare.The Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre hosted close to 3,000 experts discussing the latest advances in healthcare – representatives of enterprises, startups, research institutions and healthcare organizations, as well as decision-makers and thought leaders. The Finland Pavilion, the largest country section, presented 80 Finnish enterprises and organizations that together provided a comprehensive cross-section of top Finnish health expertise.\\nThe Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre in Helsinki hosted close to 3,000 health experts\\n\\nThe presentation of the Finland Pavilion both showcased the main themes of the conference and underscored the key roles that Finland plays in those themes: integration of social services and healthcare, community-based care (or home care), secure and ethical flow of data, artificial intelligence and open innovation.\\nThe Finland Pavilion, the largest country section, presented 80 Finnish enterprises and organizations\\n\\n“Finland is well positioned to be a key player in the future of health,” comments one of the conference’s international guests, Patrick Loerch, Ph.D., of World Without Disease Accelerator of Janssen. Janssen is a pharmaceutical company of the American multinational Johnson & Johnson corporation.Patrick Loerch, Ph.D, VP, Global Head Data Sciences & Prevention Biomarkers, World Without Disease Accelerator, JanssenLoerch, titled Vice President and Global Head Data Sciences & Prevention Biomarkers, describes his organization’s view of the future of health as follows:“Healthcare will continue to evolve rapidly, spurred by deeper understanding of diseases and through the application and integration of data science and new technologies. Our focus at Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator is to move from today’s disease care to a future health care paradigm, where solutions maintain health. “We see that the priorities are, first, collaboration among the life science ecosystem – that is, patients, physicians, industry, academia, tech, health authorities and payers – and, second, a commitment to accelerate and to deliver transformational innovations that prevent, intercept and cure diseases. “We see that the application of AI is a foundational part in this commitment. AI holds great promise and represents an important pillar in our efforts at Janssen.”The City of Helsinki and its partners the University of Helsinki and HUS Helsinki University Hospital under the umbrella of Health Capital Helsinki are key collaborators in the HIMSS and Health 2.0 European Conference. They also had an active presence in the 2019 programme and on the exhibition floor.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, Director of Economic Development, explains, “Health is a growing economic sector internationally, and health tech is Finland’s fastest-growing export business. Health and wellbeing are also a growing industry in Helsinki. We see HIMSS as a good way to support that growth.”Marja-Leena Rinkineva, Director of Economic Development, and Juha Paakkola, Director of Health Capital HelsinkiHelsinki will continue to host the conference for another two years – both in 2020 and 2021.“HIMSS strengthens Helsinki’s brand in health and wellbeing in more ways than one,” Rinkineva continues. “The fact that we can pull together such a large event as this strengthens our image as a significant player in health, and it proves that Helsinki is developing into a notable health tech hub – a true Health Capital.“Furthermore, HIMSS allows us to showcase many of our strengths, including a successful integration of social services and healthcare, and our combination of topnotch medical research and technology. “I was happy to see the conference’s large attendance, which exceeded our expectations. The overall atmosphere was good. Helsinki will benefit from concrete new international business and partnerships produced as a result of HIMSS.” Helsinki Business Hub, an international trade and investment development agency for the Helsinki metropolitan area, focused at the conference on expounding the area’s strengths in health. “We see HIMSS as a way to create value and as a mechanism to develop investments,” says Helsinki Business Hub CEO Marja-Liisa Niinikoski.“Our main message is that the future of health can be found and is created in Helsinki. We base this claim on solid arguments,” Niinikoski asserts.“First, data is the new gold, and its importance will be growing further. Finland is a technology-driven country that has built solid IT expertise over decades. Now data analytics and artificial intelligence competencies combine with top medical research and clinical expertise in Finland, to produce world-leading capabilities in digital health. Digital health solutions enable proactive, preventive and personalized care, which are the future of health.”Marja-Liisa Niinikoski, CEO, Helsinki Business Hub (HBH) at the HBH loungeFinland possesses particular strengths in the integration of digital health data with genome information. A prime example cited by Niinikoski is FinnGen, a major public-private collaboration based at the University of Helsinki.Another prime example of Finland’s strengths in digital health cited by Niinikoski is iCAN, also based at the University of Helsinki. iCAN combines precision cancer medicine and digital health. Niinikoski underscored her declaration that the future of health is made in Helsinki with a panel discussion on the digital twin concept in healthcare, held on the Stage of the conference exhibition floor. Five panelists envisioned uses of this concept, new in health, from the patient point of view. “If we can produce a digital twin of a human being, we can make major advances in preventive healthcare,” Niinikoski commented.\\nA panel on the use of the digital twin concept in healthcare, moderated by Marja-Liisa Niinikoski, CEO, Helsinki Business Hub.

We should take our expertise further in order to help others in Finland to move on. The HUS competencies should benefit all of Finland.” HUS, the biggest healthcare provider in Finland, is part of the Health Capital Helsinki alliance.Visa Honkanen, Chief Digital Officer of HUS Helsinki University HospitalHonkanen had begun his tour in the morning by accepting a HIMSS award, HIMSS-Elsevier Digital Healthcare Award for Outstanding ICT Achievement, conferred to the Health Village virtual hospital, a national Finnish project that was initiated by HUS but today includes all Finnish university hospitals.“The 16,500 monthly visitors to Health Village exemplify why Finland, according to an EU estimate, is Europe’s Number One country in digitalization,” Honkanen says. HUS conducts pioneering work to digitalize healthcare with digital care pathways. Elaborating on leadership in digital health, Honkanen points out, however, that it would require a thorough cultural change to make digital care pathways the primary pathways.“Digitalization is a good thing, but it should always be complemented by personal encounters the combination of digital care and personal encounters is key to super-efficient healthcare. That’s the grand idea behind digital health. “When we develop AI-based solutions in healthcare, it’s not enough to have the best data scientist and the best clinician they have to be integrated to create added value. That’s where Finland excels: the creation of this added value, coupled with vast amounts of data and, importantly, trust. “Finnish society is based on trust, and Finnish customers are confident that their data is treated with respect. The trust comes from the high achievements of the Finnish education system, which produces sophisticated customers. Digitalization is the faster and the more successful the more trust there is in society.“To sum up, Finland excels in health because we have the three essentials in place: tools, rules and schools – the technology to analyze data, the rules that govern the use of data, and a high-achieving education system.” Timo Lukkarinen, City of Helsinki Medical Director, took the Stage to complete Day One on the exhibition floor. He highlighted how Helsinki public healthcare points to the future of health.Timo Lukkarinen, Medical Director, City of HelsinkiLukkarinen presented a system of health benefit analysis applied by Helsinki using a special tool developed in Finland to analyze the care history of patients. The tool uses all indicators and data recorded on patients over their entire history of public healthcare, such as smoking habits. The data analysis can be used to produce preventive and personalized care solutions. The tool can pick out subgroups of patients at risk and allow targeted care to be directed at those groups. The tool shows the power of data analytics in public healthcare. “It has the power to revolutionize public health,” Lukkarinen envisions.Helsinki Business Hub continued its exploration of the future of health with a panel discussion on the morning of Thursday, 13 June, focusing on shared decision-making by using AI.The discussion was inspired by an AI-powered tool developed by Solita, a company that specializes in digital transformation, and the Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement. The new tool can revolutionize the work of surgeons. It supports doctors in making decisions and helps them to evaluate treatment methods and risks related to surgery. But questions arise when medical decision-making is transferred to a machine.Solita’s Director of Health and Wellbeing Division, Risto Kaikkonen, comments, “Such systems represent dramatic transformation in healthcare. AI makes healthcare more efficient, but AI-based systems introduce new aspects to healthcare to consider, ranging from legal aspects to ethics to consumer markets.”Risto Kaikkonen, Solita’s Director of Health and Wellbeing DivisionThe Helsinki Business Hub–moderated panel tackled those aspects, continuing to make the future of health in Helsinki.More informationHIMSS & Health 2.0 European ConferenceHIMSS – Healthcare Information and Management Systems SocietyHelsinki Business Hub – HealthHealth Capital Helsinki\\nText: Johanna LemolaPhotos: Ilkka Ranta-aho\\n\\n', 'The City of Helsinki Audit Committee observed things to fix and develop, for example, in the realisation of mental health services for children and adolescents. In its Annual Assessment Report, the audit committee recommends that the City reorganises its operations and, if necessary, allocates additional resources in order to set up a unit for the evaluation and treatment of minor and intermediate mental health problems among children and adolescents. The unit would also function as a location for special health care follow-up treatment.Furthermore, a joint appraisal of the mental health services for children and adolescents was made together with the cities of the Helsinki Capital Region and HUS. As part of the appraisal, it was observed that the service system is patchy, particularly in Helsinki. Helsinki lacks an authority responsible for the mental health services for children and adolescents, which would be able to offer psychiatric outpatient treatment in cases of minor or intermediate disturbances. It was recommended that Helsinki’s social services and health care division and education division work together to appoint a person in charge of the co-ordination of the services. The divisions must also improve the availability of mental health services in school and student health care. The co-operation with HUS should be increased to ease the shortage of doctors and to develop the care pathway in adolescent psychiatry.In its 2018 Annual Assessment Report, the Helsinki Audit Committee processes 18 different topics and proposes 49 recommendations in total. The recommendations concern, among other things, development of primary education and informal care, as well as increased efficiency in carrying out the emissions reductions. The pupils’ need for remedial instruction and special support has increased. The principals of primary schools find that more special education teachers are needed in the schools. Based on the assessment, the schools need extra resources when the number of pupils in need of remedial instruction and special support increases. The pupils in need of support are located especially in the northern and north-eastern areas. The need for additional support exists in better-off areas and less multicultural school areas as well. The supply of services in support of informal care for people aged over 65 is more extensive in Helsinki than what is prescribed by law, but the supply does not entirely match the needs of the customers. An essential problem is that the system of time-off and substitutes for informal caregivers does not work as the informal caregivers would like it to.\\xa0 The Audit Committee notes that the share of informal care has dropped in Helsinki and it has not been possible to increase its attractiveness among other forms of care. It is important that opportunities to be an informal caregiver are communicated more extensively, for example, to working people. At the same time, the accessibility of informal care services should be improved, for example, by arranging transports to the services. The City of Helsinki has not yet managed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions substantially, although many measures have been taken. In the City Strategy, Helsinki has set a 60 percent emissions reduction goal for the year 2030 and a carbon neutrality goal for the year 2035. In its Annual Assessment Report, the Audit Committee states that the City must increase its co-operations in the implementation of the emissions reduction with the business sector, the residents of the city and the housing cooperatives. The achievement of the reduction goals for transportation emissions should be furthered by more efficient means.The Audit Committee is an organ that reports to the City Council and whose task is to assess the extent to which the goals set by the City Council have been fulfilled. The 2018 Annual Assessment Report can be read at: www.arviointikertomus.fi.The City Council will process the Assessment Report at its meeting on 19 June 2019.Further information:Dan Koivulaakso, Chair of the Audit Committee, 044 5066 613, dan.koivulaakso@gmail.comTimo Terävä, Audit Director, 050\\xa0435 7547, timo.terava@hel.fi2018\\nAnnual Assessment ReportAudit CommitteeAudit Department', \"Caption: Helsinki maritime strategy project manager Minttu Perttula giving a hand with the city rowboats as they were landing at Töölönlahti.With Skipperi’s city rowboat service, you may now hit the Helsinki waters without having your own boat. The booking period started in the end of May and initially there are boats at two locations: At Laajalahti in conjunction with Café Torpanranta in Munkkiniemi and at Töölönlahti by the Finlandia Hall in conjunction with Café Veranda. In June, a boat rental point will also open by Aurinkolahti beach in Vuosaari.There is an e-service where you may book a boat in advance the time limit for one rowing tour is three hours. The fee for a season pass to the service is 25 euros.The arrival of the city rowboats is part of the implementation of Helsinki's maritime strategy, the expansion of the Helsinkians’ maritime territory and the empowering of people to take possession of the beaches. At the same time, the service helps Helsinki achieve the goals of the City’s exercise and mobility scheme.“We will carry on with our effort to make the sea and the nearby archipelago more accessible in accordance with our theme ‘The sea belongs to everybody’. The combination of the metro, the city bikes and the city boats will bring maritime Helsinki within reach of people who do not have access to a boat of their own”, Helsinki maritime strategy project manager Minttu Perttula is pleased to tell.“By making things together, as in the current case with Skipperi, we will be able to bring about the best results regarding the maritime strategy and the strengthening of Helsinki’s maritime character. We took another important step when we added the schedules for the waterborne traffic to the Journey Planner, something that was done jointly with Helsinki Regional Transport Authority HSL, the City of Espoo and the ferry entrepreneurs”, Perttula asserts.The service comprises altogether about ten boats for hire. After the launching this summer, the City aims at increasing the number of boats, and there are plans for a fourth boat rental in Herttoniemi.Now open:• Laajalahti, Café Torpanranta, Munkkiniemenranta 2 (2–3 boats)• Töölönlahti, Finlandia Hall, Café Veranda, Karamzininranta (3–4 boats)To be opened 15th of June:• Vuosaari, Aurinkolahti beach (3 boats)Helsinki’s maritime strategy outlines the development of the service supply and attractiveness of the archipelago and the waterfront until year 2030. The goal is to develop the maritime services and the accessibility of the maritime locations, to promote maritime events and to stay on course opening up the nearby archipelago for recreational use.Further informationSkipperi city boats (an English version of the e-booking service also to open in June)Hel.fi: In islandsMyhelsinki.fi – Seaside HelsinkiHelsinki Service Map\", \"Once again, Helsinki Startup Day was a success. More than one thousand people had registered and those who participated in the event praised the diverse programme and also the sense of community. People felt welcome, whether they were sent by a small startup enterprise or by a company that is already well on its way to growth.Marja-Leena Rinkineva, who is Helsinki’s director of economic development, reiterated in her opening remarks that the organisers of this and the previous event had intended it as an opportunity for local startup players to get together.This year, the organisers wanted to include young companies from the other Nordic countries and the Baltic States, i.e. the New Nordics area. Now, the event themes were games as well as health and wellness.As the world is shrinking, the competition is getting tougher. Rinkineva asserted that Helsinki is already a veteran startup city, but to be successful globally, bigger players are needed. For the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, it would pay off to rally together and to expand the companies and the market to dimensions that are large even in a European perspective.There is clearly a big demand for this kind of event, said Tommo Koivusalo, head of NewCo Helsinki, and Marja-Leena Rinkineva, director of economic development.The idea is to give the participants all at once a comprehensive grip on the Helsinkian startup scene, new and useful information and valuable new connections. The timing of the event, i.e. the first week of June, has been chosen quite on purpose, as that is the super week of international startup events in Helsinki.– We in the municipal organisation do not start up businesses, but we can create the best imaginable business environment. This is what we work for, and that is what Startup Day is about, Rinkineva concludes.All startup companies and everybody with an interest in joining the ecosystem was eligible to participate in the event programme, as the organisers wanted to enable entrance to all interested.Rinkineva pointed out that the Finnish gaming industry is world-famous, but that there was now great potential in health care.Therefore, she was pleased with the fact that companies representing both industries but also interested investors were in attendance in such large numbers.Aside from speeches, the Startup Day programme included, among other things, workshops and speed business meetings.Head of unit Tommo Koivusalo reminded the participants of the notion that no one is able to succeed on his own. Particularly in the modern world, you cannot advance without access to networks.Koivusalo asserted that there is an abundance of confidence in the world’s happiest country. This facilitates communication and network building substantially. In Helsinki, these are sought after, especially coupled with Scandinavians and people from the Baltic States.– NewCo Helsinki is a great place to work, because there our job is to help new entrepreneurs and enterprises, Koivusalo added glowingly.Rinkineva and Koivusalo hypothesised that the popularity of the event is a sign of the community spirit of startup companies in the Helsinki Capital Region.– People have a need to meet others, to make contact and to find new ideas, Rinkineva said.– There is an urge to work together here. There is an intimate atmosphere and people are prepared to share information. Why not describe this as startup casual? Koivusalo suggested.Another sign of the community spirit was a piece of news that broke that day. The community of gaming companies in the Capital Region is about to establish a new gaming association that will promote the growth and culture of gaming companies. Joint voluntary work will make the association come true and keep it running.The programme of the event included several interesting speeches. Svein Berg of Nordic Innovation, who was one of the anticipated speakers, underlined the importance of scale-ups, i.e. growth-oriented companies.Svein Berg encouraged startups to grow.Nordic Innovation sets innovations in motion and finances them. Its key partners are Nordic small and medium-size businesses. It has also teamed up with Maria 01, which is a cluster of Helsinkian startup and growth companies.– As much as we are talking about startups, we as nations need growing companies above all.He thinks that the Nordic countries and the Baltic States form a region that has everything that is needed to generate even fast business growth. There is a business-friendly atmosphere, there is no corruption and the infrastructure works.According to statistics, in years 2013–2016 the Nordic scale-ups generated 200,000 new jobs.He pointed out that nobody was born to lead a growth company. The entrepreneurs need acceleration programmes and mentoring.– It is an excellent thing that we are able to join forces, share information and support entrepreneurship, Berg asserts.Christine Ritter came from Denmark to talk about acceleration programmes. She summed up the three greatest needs of startups: they should get assistance to obtain funding, to recruit staff and to find suitable facilities and equipment.Christine Ritter thinks it would be excellent for startup enterprises to be provided with facilities and equipment.Olavi Mertanen, of FiBAN that represents business angels, had one of the most popular workshops of the event. He stayed on to answer questions still a long time after closing up shop.Mertanen made the point that a good startup will still be able to obtain funding, even though economic growth is expected to slow down.– There are plenty of interesting enterprises in the Capital Region. Personally, I follow keenly what is going on with the education startups that get a tailwind from the good reputation of the Finnish education system.According to Mertanen’s shortlist of keys to success, you need a good business idea, and in addition to that, a well-functioning network and the capacity to introduce the story of the company, as demanded, in three minutes, or in two or one, in Finnish and in English.– The story can never be too good, you should invest yourself in it with due care.Olavi Mertanen of FiBAN that represents business angels set up a very popular workshop.Startup Estonia's Maarika Truu gave a talk about the situation for startups in Estonia. She assured that funding is to be found for good ideas and talents in Estonia as well.– We have about 550 startups, which is a lot for a country of 1.3 million inhabitants. Soon startups will employ approximately 5,000 people, and our companies too do suffer from a shortage of labour.Maarika Truu talked about the Estonian startups and their situation.Truu reminded that the Nordic countries and Estonia have cooperated previously as well. For instance, Skype was set up jointly by the Swedes, the Danes and the Estonians.There is strength in cooperation, emphasised Suvi Latva of Baltic Games Industry and Per Strömbäck of Dataspelsbranschen, who were interviewed as part of a panel discussion.Strömbäck made the audience laugh when he stated that the Swedes love the Finns in particular: In case the Swedes do not win the hockey games themselves, they want the Finns to come out as winners.Suvi Latva and Per Strömbäck on stage being interviewed by Koopee Hiltunen (centre).Taina Myöhänen gave a presentation about the recently established Women in Games Finland association, which works for diversity within the gaming industry. The community was originally a Facebook group, but as the number of followers had reached one thousand plus, an association was set up.In spite of its name, the association does not promote the female angle only, but rather diversity more generally.Myöhänen points out that there are many hidden jobs in the gaming industry. The management recruits people from among their acquaintances, or then friends of friends are selected to fill vacancies, and so diverse backgrounds are not perceived as a plus for game development.Taina Myöhänen provided a reminder of the great benefits of diversity to the gaming industry.Information was disseminated also unofficially, in the corridors and during the quarters of an hour of speed meetings. The speed meetings or matchmaking was one of the most successful parts of the big event, as about 700 bilateral meetings took place. Some had set up meetings already in advance and some were set up in the course of the day based on data from the matching system.The participants gave much praise for the 15-minute meetings, and many had several. One of them was Jesse Tran, who had made quite a few inspiring appointments on behalf of his Rens Coffee Shoes Company, which produces running shoes from coffee grounds and recycled plastics.Jesse Tran introduced shoes produced by his enterprise, Rens Coffee Shoes, to Truc Doan.Fedor Tyurin addressed some questions about Maria 01 to Tiina Nyman. The startup cluster had attracted Tyurin’s attention, as he had heard about it from other young enterprises and was aware that many talented people have come together in the facilities of what formerly was a hospital.Fedor Tyurin of Enable Banking wanted to know more about Maria 01. Tiina Nyman explains.Tyurin had come to Startup Day to network. Even his colleagues had pushed him to get moving to reach out to people as he otherwise spends most of his working days in the company of his laptop.The Barracuda Disaster was appreciative as well. This enterprise develops a comedic game for childlike adults.– It was excellent to get here, because we need people to test the game and then we collect their feedback, Henri Taussi explained.The enterprise is also on the lookout for a publisher and for funding. Taussi thinks it is great that Helsinki Startup Day is open to everybody without an entry fee.Jenni Pennanen, Henri Taussi and Teemu Viisanen of Barracuda Disaster had the opportunity to collect feedback from gamers.Roshnii Chou of the recently established company Peaso described her mood as that of being extremely impressed. She wanted to find out whom of the City of Helsinki staff she should thank for the event.Peaso’s Roshnii Chou at a speed meeting with Otso Mursula of KÄÄPÄ Health wanted to know whether she would be able to use the latter company’s laboratory for testing.Chou’s company is geared towards the health and wellness industry and reforms the Japanese miso soup to be Western, gluten-free and completely vegan. Her goal is to export new “Nordic style” health food to all of Europe. She had a speed meeting with e.g. Otso Mursulan of Kääpä Health.– Here, I got completely new ideas and new perspectives on how to develop a company, Chou rounded off.Original text in Finnish: Kirsi RiipinenImages: Ilkka Ranta-ahoFurther readingNewCo HelsinkiMaria 01\", 'Radio Suomipop’s amazing Helsinki Day Concert 12 June will fill the Kaisaniemi\\xa0park with people and top artists again on Helsinki Day.

The programme has been created by local residents and this year it highlights topical themes such as responsibility and climate change.\\n  Helsinki will be filled with a festival atmosphere on the city’s birthday, 12 June, with over a hundred individual events spread out across dozens of districts and neighbourhoods. The programme includes art and music, sports and exercise, guided tours, workshops and garden parties. All of the events are free of charge and open to all. “This year’s programme includes lots to do also for senior citizens. No less than three of the city’s service centres are participating by organising, for example, theatre performances and festivals for elderly people. The programme also highlights the themes of responsibility and climate change,” says Marianne Saukkonen, Executive Producer from the Helsinki Event Foundation.The environmental theme will be seen throughout Helsinki: people can play a climate change game on their phones by the Töölönlahti bay, surplus food will be reutilised at a picnic in Lapinlahti, and kids can build machines to improve the world at City Hall. Event continues to grow year after year Helsinki Day has expanded with each year, offering an increasingly diverse programme along the way. While the event is coordinated by the City of Helsinki, the programme itself is designed by local residents. Helsinki Day is all about the people of the city, so the programme offers something for everyone – from theatre orienteering to traditional games and 1920s-style public exercises to robot bus rides. “Helsinki Day is a communal and participatory festival that involves dozens of local associations, businesses and residents. It encourages people to do things and experience them together. The day also nurtures local pride among residents while introducing our districts and neighbourhoods to visitors,” Saukkonen says. As in previous years, a jury of local influencers awarded production grants to almost twenty Helsinki Day events on the basis of applications. The members of this year’s jury were Pauli Saloranta, Teemu Lehto, Renaz Ebrahimi, Sonja Kailassaari, Mari Nieminen, Max TalviOja, Mirja Arajärvi and Marianne Saukkonen. The programme for Helsinki Day, which has been held since 1959, includes such classic events as morning coffees with the mayor and award ceremonies for City Slang man and woman of the year and local athletes of the year.

Address: Pohjoisesplanadi 11-13.From 12:30–15, the City Hall’s Event Square is the stage for building a machine to improve the world. The challenge is to invent and assemble a machine that can make the world a better place. The machine or robot can be anything you like – your imagination is the limit.

Last year, more than one million bike trips were made along the country’s busiest cycling route, Lauttasaari Bridge, as well as through Hesperia Park near the National Opera and across Pitkäsilta Bridge. However, while the number of cycling journeys has increased, the proportion cycling accounts for of all transport has not increased as planned. Helsinki’s goal is to have 15\\xa0per cent of all journeys made by bike by 2020. Last year, the figure was 11\\xa0per cent.‘The promotion of cycling is not an end in itself rather, it is a means of creating a safer, more comfortable and more functional urban environment. The more people travel on foot, by bicycle or by public transport, rather than by car, the greater the number of people who can efficiently move about the city,’ says the City’s cycling coordinator Reetta Keisanen.In order to increase the proportion cycling makes up of all transport, Helsinki will build new, high-quality cycle routes. Over the next few years, the main focus will be on the inner city, because the bike routes’ connectivity issues are most notable there. The new inner-city bike route network is intended to be finished by the end of 2025. This year, cycle routes will be constructed on Mechelininkatu, Tukholmankatu and Paciuksenkatu. The renovation work on Hämeentie began this spring, and the new cycle routes there will be completed next year.In addition to the routes in the inner city, the construction of the Baana network will continue. The building projects for the Baana underpass underneath the Central Railway Station’s tracks, Viikinbaana and Itäbaana in Kulosaari will begin next year. The planned length of the finished Baana network is 130\\xa0kilometres. So far, six kilometres of Baana routes, i.e. less than one kilometre per year, have been completed since 2012. When it comes to factors that affect the cycling experience amongst the City’s residents, exceptional cycling route arrangements during roadworks cause the most dissatisfaction. On the other hand, residents are increasingly satisfied with the combination of cycling and public transport. A total of 94\\xa0per cent of Helsinki’s residents support to the promotion of cycling.‘For many Helsinkians, bicycles are a common way of getting from point A to point B. During the seasons without snow, more than half of the City’s residents ride a bicycle weekly,’ Reetta Keisanen says. In May, the City of Helsinki published a leaflet called Bicycle Account 2019. This document discusses the development of bike travel, resident opinions regarding cycling, cycling plans and construction projects. Printed versions are available at the central library Oodi’s urban environment participatory facility Brygga, among other places. Further\\nreading:', \"What if future Helsinki would offer a possibility to celebrate a night\\nof the galleries or participate in late evening meditation in school gyms? Or to tour the archipelago on a nightly sea cruise and to go to the\\nswimming pool at four in the morning? The possibilities of Helsinki's evening\\nand night are discussed in a report ordered by the City of Helsinki Culture and\\nLeisure Division, which was published today. \\nAn interesting nightlife is an essential part of a city’s attractiveness. In spring 2018, a group of night-time operators in Helsinki gathered to discuss the development of the City’s nightlife. The briefings by the night mayors of Amsterdam and Berlin and the joint discussions resulted in the thought that Helsinki could also gain more from its nightlife.Based on the meeting, the City of Helsinki's Culture and Leisure Division commissioned a report on the potential of the City’s nightlife from the perspective of the service producers. The report, published today, includes an array of actions through which Helsinki’s night could send a message of an international and attractive City.– All the service producers who participated in the report recognised a lot of unused potential in the night of Helsinki. The result does not surprise me. Nightly Helsinki cannot be overlooked – people want to live during the nights as well, notes Helsinki Deputy Mayor Nasima Razmyar.– Helsinki is an international and modern large city, which also includes a lively urban life during night-time. As we create more opportunities for work, services, events and hobbies, we need to make sure that this can be realised safely and without causing disturbances. In the most functional City in the world, the nightlife must also be good life for everyone, emphasises Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.Less\\nbureaucracy and more courage wanted from CityIn the report, it is suggested that the City prepares a night strategy and vision together with the service producers.\\xa0 New nightlife initiatives could initially be tested to a restricted extent in terms of area, division and time, for example through a monthly night of the museums or in specific night neighbourhoods. A lot of potential was also seen in the contrast between light and darkness in Helsinki, the nightless summer nights and the darkness of the winter.\\nAs for the City of Helsinki’s role, the service producers expressed wishes related to everyday bureaucracy, such as development of the licence procedures for nightly activities and distinct contact persons at the City. Financial support and assistance in communications and marketing for evening and night event trials was also on the list.The City should also show courage in developing unique night-time events in Helsinki. Furthermore, the service producers wanted the City to pay attention to the functionality of the night-time traffic and the City’s security during night as well.Helsinki\\nhires a night liaisonThe City will hire a night liaison to coordinate the nightlife trials and opportunities.– At the beginning of my term, I spoke about a “night mayor”. Now Helsinki has decided to join that group of international cities, who have recognised the importance of evening and night-time and hired a specific person for the purpose somewhere it is a night tsar, somewhere a night mayor, while we have a night liaison, cheers Deputy Mayor Razmyar.\\n– The night liaison hired by Helsinki works as an interpreter and voice between the developers of the nightlife in Helsinki and the City of Helsinki. The liaison’s task is, above all, to recognise, assist and gather the makers of Helsinki, who want to develop the evenings and nights of Helsinki into something funnier, more eventful and safer.The recruitment process will start in the autumn and the fixed-term assignment runs through June 2021. The night liaison will work at the City Executive Office Communications unit, whose responsibility it is to coordinate the development of the City’s event scene.The report was made by LiveFIN ry on commission of the City of Helsinki Culture and Leisure Division in December 2018 and January 2019. For the report, the makers interviewed the City of Helsinki’s external service producers, e.g. in trade, music festivals, restaurant business and sports, accommodation and traffic services as well as museum and performing arts actors.Link to the study (in Finnish)\", 'Helsinki Day on 12 June will fill the city again with celebrations, as more than 100 events take place throughout the city.

More details on this will be provided during the summer.The worksite also affects car traffic, as lanes switch places in the Pasilansilta and Ratapihantie junction. The new lane arrangements have been clearly marked on the road. The number of lanes will mostly remain the same.The reason for these traffic arrangements is the worksite of the new public transport terminal.“The construction of the new public transport terminal in Pasilansilta proceeds rapidly. The old tracks of Pasila public transport terminal will be disassembled during the summer, the old bridge deck will be repaired and the new tracks installed,” says Project Manager Juuso Luoto, describing the work to be done during the summer.During the tram transport shutdown, water pipe and district heating connections will be built under Pasilankatu, at Kyllikinportti, which also causes disruptions to traffic. Drivers are recommended to avoid driving in the Pasila area the entire summer if alternative routes are possible.The Pasilansilta public transport terminal will be commissioned in late October 2019. When the construction is finished, the new junction area and the public transport terminal will better serve the traffic flows in the entire developing Pasila area.The renewal of Keski-Pasila is a part of the comprehensive renewal project of Pasila, in which the city centre of Helsinki will expand into Pasila. In future years, Pasila will develop into an increasingly significant and livelier centre, thanks to notable new construction and transportation projects in the area.

Artist Maria Stereo’s four-metre bronze sculpture Timeless will be installed in the courtyard of the city’s Adult Education Institute on Teollisuuskatu in Vallila on Tuesday, 4 June.\\nThere are no hands on the face of the decorative clock, and the cuckoo’s door remains closed. Just as the title implies, the work is timeless: the clockface does not indicate the hour. Artist Maria Stereo says that timelessness gives viewers a chance to relax. You don’t always have to know what the time it is.“I’ve always been fascinated by domestic kitsch objects and decorations. When I began to explore online images of cuckoo clocks, I found myself in a fantastic world of the most diverse carpentry skills. The fascination carried me into creating a series of clocks using all kinds of mixed media. The works in the series represented autobiographical points in time for me, as it were. One of the clocks was cast in type metal, and that piece eventually triggered the idea for Timeless,” the artist says.Last September, a work by artist Anssi Kasitonni was installed in the same site. Similarly produced under the Percent for Art programme, the work, entitled Epifania de Liberace, is a glittering grand piano that seems to be descending from the ceiling among a rain of glitter.Maria Stereo (b. 1979 in Rauma) has had solo exhibitions in Gallery Huuto in Helsinki and Mältinranta in Tampere. She has also participated in numerous group exhibitions. Alongside her work as a visual artist, Stereo also makes music with her band Maria ja Marsilaiset (‘Maria and the Martians’).

Stereo and Kasitonni live and work in Sahalahti, Kangasala.The City of Helsinki follows the Percent for Art principle under which roughly one percent of the cost of the construction of new properties or the renovation of old ones is earmarked for public art.

      "[\"If you’ve checked out the City of Boston’s YouTube account — or follow the City of Boston’s social channels — you might have noticed a recent uptick in our video output. This year, we worked with New Urban Mechanics and the City's Press Office to hire two digital storytellers, and the results have been amazing.Our storytelling team uses video to promote residents’ voices, and share information about important City services. One of our biggest project this year was the City’s first short-form documentary about the Boston Marathon markers that commemorate the lives lost in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. They also support other City staff and departments, “teaching others to fish,” where possible.Over the past year, we’ve launched a few different video series that cover a number of topics. You can learn more about our work below:We’re highlighting Boston’s rich history and how the City is trying to preserve it. The series features a range of voices, from the City Archaeologist’s latest findings to stories told from the City Archivist, to local community advocates working to preserve historic sites.Each “In Your Shoes” episode serves as a window into the life of a specific person and how they’ve received support from City services. Our goal is to elevate the voices of those often marginalized or misrepresented. This is a platform for Boston residents to tell their own stories. And, we hope, inspire even more community spirit for one another.\\xa0This series shows how Boston Public School students are learning outside of the classroom. We’ll highlight programs and educators that have done something different, innovative, or creative in the City. Email us at digital@boston.gov if you have a teacher or a program you would like to nominate!\\xa0Our team is examining how future-focused policies and ideas are helping to shape a better Boston. These videos will look at the current work as it is happening, with our five main topic areas for next year being:This series will showcase policy work, City tech, mayoral priorities, infrastructure updates, climate change, and more.\\xa0Working with Human Resources, we created a video series highlighting interesting careers at the City of Boston. Our goal with each episode is to pique people’s interest in applying to City jobs. We also spotlight current City workers and showcase the important work they do everyday.Aside from our ongoing series, there are special circumstances for one-off, interesting videos when the need arises. And, we’re always open to suggestions.\\xa0Have a topic or area of the City you want us to focus on? Please tell us by emailing feedback@boston.gov. If there’s a great City story that needs to be told, we want to help give it life.\", 'Shem Drowne, the Boston metalworker who had fashioned the grasshopper, repaired the grasshopper and restored it to its place on top of Fanueil Hall. However, only a few years later, in 1761, the grasshopper was again damaged by a fire at the Hall. This time, it was repaired by Shem’s son, Thomas.\\xa0The grasshopper continued to find its way to earth. On Evacuation Day in 1889, a flag being lowered knocked it to the ground. In 1974, it was stolen and missing for more than six months. Despite its adventures, the grasshopper always seems to return to its perch!', 'BOSTON - Friday, November 15, 2018 - Mayor Martin J. Walsh today joined City officials at the Public Works yard on Frontage Road to discuss winter preparations currently underway in the City of Boston, and resources available to residents.\\xa0\"The most important thing we can do every winter is be prepared, before, during and after every storm,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"As a City, our top priority is to keep our residents safe, and during the winter season, I\\'m asking each and every resident to stay alert, and look after your family, friends and neighbors, especially those who may be isolated or have health concerns. The City of Boston is ready to tackle any weather that comes our way, and I encourage residents to take advantage of the resources the City has to keep you informed, safe and prepared.\"The Public Works Department (PWD) currently has 48,000 tons of salt on-hand to treat City streets. Along with 110 pieces of in-house snow clearing equipment, the Public Works Department has the capability to place over 600 additional pieces on the roads during larger storms. As part of their neighborhood plowing operations during winter storms and to ensure the safety of riders, the Public Works Department allocates pieces of equipment to clear snow from Boston\\'s dedicated bike lanes.\\xa0Rules on Clearing Snow:Property owners must fully clear snow, sleet and ice from sidewalks and curb ramps abutting the property within three hours after the snowfall ends or three hours after sunrise if the snow ends overnight.\\xa0Curb and pedestrian ramps to the street should be cleared fully and continually over the duration of the storm to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. If a storm will last over an extended period of time, property owners are asked to continually check ramps abutting their property for compliance. Failure to comply can result in a fine issued by PWD\\'s Code Enforcement Division.\\xa0Removal of snow, ice from a private property to the street or sidewalk is prohibited and can result in a fine issued by PWD\\'s Code Enforcement Division.Do not throw snow onto the street. Fines associated with improper removal of snow can be found\\xa0here.Remove space savers within 48 hours after a snow emergency has been lifted. Please note: space savers are NOT allowed in the South End.Safety Tips:Remember to keep catch basins and fire hydrants clear.\\xa0 For a map of catch basins and fire hydrants, visit\\xa0http://www.bwsc.org\\xa0Shoveling snow requires significant exertion please be cautious and pay attention to symptoms. Stop if you feel chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheaded, nauseous/vomiting. Call 911 if those symptoms do not resolve quickly when you stop exertion.Snow piles can make navigating intersections dangerous for walkers and drivers, please take extra care when turning corners with snow piles that might limit visibility.Carbon Monoxide poisoning is a concern during winter weather, especially with the use of generators. Residents should be sure to use their home heating systems wisely and safely, and have a working carbon monoxide detector on each floor of your home. Call 911 immediately if you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning.Sitting in a car while idling can be deadly if the tailpipe is blocked. Do not let children sit in an idling car while shoveling. Clear any household exhaust pipes of snow. For example, gas exhaust from heating system or dryer.Please check on neighbors, especially the elderly and those with disabilities.Have a contractor check the roof to see if snow needs to be removed. If roof snow can be removed from the ground with the use of a snow-rake, do so with caution. Avoid working from ladders and be mindful of slippery surfaces.\\xa0Preventing Hypothermia and FrostbiteDress for the weather:Wear several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy clothing.Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent.Wear mittens over gloves layering works for your hands as well.Always wear a hat and cover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs.\\xa0\\xa0Dress children warmly and set reasonable time limits on outdoor play.Restrict infants\\' outdoor exposure when it is colder than 40 degrees Fahrenheit.Watch for signs of frostbite:These include loss of feeling and white or pale appearance in extremities such as fingers, toes, ear lobes, and the tip of the nose.If symptoms are detected, get medical help immediately.Watch for signs of hypothermia:These include uncontrollable shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness and apparent exhaustion.If you or someone you know shows any of these symptoms, get in touch with a healthcare provider immediately. If symptoms are severe, call 911.Heating SafetyNever try to heat your home using a charcoal or gas grill, the kitchen stove, or other product not specifically designed as a heater. These can cause a fire or produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide very quickly. Using faulty or improper heating sources is the number two cause of home fires in Massachusetts.Have your heating system cleaned and checked annually.Install and maintain smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an invisible gas produced whenever any fuel is burned. Common sources include oil or gas furnaces, water heaters, fireplaces, stoves, and some space heaters. It has no smell, taste, or color. It is a poison and is deadly.Vulnerable PopulationsIf you see homeless and vulnerable individuals out in the cold who appear immobile, disoriented or underdressed for the cold, please call 911.The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) coordinates a city-wide network of emergency shelters, outreach providers, city agencies and first responders to assist those in need of shelter.Boston\\'s emergency shelters are open 24 hours and will accept any person in need.\\xa0 Men can access shelter at the 112 Southampton Street Shelter, and women should go to the Woods-Mullen Shelter at 794 Massachusetts Ave. BPHC and the City are working closely with shelter providers in the city to ensure that no client is without shelter, food, resources, and a warm respite from the cold.During extreme cold weather, street outreach teams operate with extended hours and provide mobile outreach vans on the streets in the evening and throughout the day.Heat Guidelines for Property Owners and TenantsIn accordance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, the heating season officially begins on September 15 and runs through June 15. Property owners must heat habitable spaces at a minimum temperature of 68° between 7 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64° between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m.In case of emergency, property owners are encouraged to keep a list of licensed contractors (electrician, plumber and general contractor) on file. Tenants experiencing problems with their heating system should check the thermostat, ensure the dial is turned on, and report insufficient or no heat problems to the property owner or manager immediately.If your landlord or property manager is unresponsive, contact the Inspectional Services Department (ISD) at (617) 635-5300 to file a complaint, or call 311.\\xa0\\xa0Tips to keep water flowing and pipes unfrozen during extreme coldThe Boston Water and Sewer Commission recommends that during the upcoming cold snap homeowners remember the words locate, insulate, and circulate.Locate a home\\'s main water shut off valve, and learn how to use it. Should a frozen pipe burst, shutting the main valve quickly will minimize flooding and property damage.Insulate pipes in unheated areas like basements, garages and crawl spaces. Use inexpensive hardware store materials to prevent pipes from freezing and to keep warm water flowing.Circulate warm air around pipes by keeping cabinet doors open. Circulate a trickle of tap water through pipes during extreme cold to help prevent them freezing up.Locate your water meter, protect it from drafts, and make sure basement doors and windows are shut tight.If pipes do freeze, slow thaw with a hair dryer. If water is lost in all taps, call BWSC 24-hour Emergency Assistance Line at 617-989-7000.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Increasing Home Energy EfficiencyDisconnect water hose from the home.Wrap or cover exposed spigots.Caulk or putty windows.Ensure kitchen and bathroom dampers close properly.Close all storm windows and doors.Apply weather stripping.Properly insulate all pipes that are exposed.Cover vents.Install insulated or heavy drapes to keep cold drafts from coming in.Don\\'t forget to close the damper to wood burning fireplace after each use. Consider a chimney balloon if you don\\'t have a damper.For more energy efficiency tips for your home, call Renew Boston at 617-635-SAVE (7283).Emergency Home RepairIncome eligible homeowners and Boston\\'s residents over age 60 can receive assistance with winter emergencies and repairs, such as fixing storm damage, leaking roofs, furnaces and leaking/frozen pipes. For assistance, residents should call the Mayor\\'s hotline at 311 or the Boston Home Center at 617-635-HOME (4663).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A grant up to $5,000 is available for income eligible homeowners over age 60 to ease unexpected financial burdens caused by an emergency situation with their home.In addition, the Mayor\\'s Seniors Save program helps income eligible Bostonians over the age of 60 replace old, inefficient heating systems with a new brand new heating system even before a catastrophic failure occurs during the cold winter months. Older adults can also call 311 or the Boston Home Center at (617) 635-HOME (4663) to be connected with a City staffer to provide additional details.Emergency OperationsThe City of Boston Office of Emergency Management (OEM) remains in constant contact with the National Weather Service to receive detailed forecasts for the City of Boston. It also ensures each City department has a plan in place to handle the forecast. If the storm warrants, the City\\'s Emergency Operations Center will be activated and City representatives will coordinate response and recovery efforts.Residents who sign up for notifications will receive a message from the City about winter storms and extreme cold weather. This notification system also alerts residents when a snow emergency/parking ban is in effect and when it is being lifted.Trash and Recycling\\xa0During severe snowstorms, recycling and trash collection may be cancelled, but this is extremely rare. Most often, severe snowstorms can cause delays in service, so we ask for your cooperation and patience. To view your neighborhood recycling and trash schedule and to find out what items you\\xa0CAN\\xa0and\\xa0CAN\\'T\\xa0recycle, please visit:\\xa0boston.gov/trash-day\\xa0and download the Trash Day App.Crews have a difficult time reaching trash barrels and recycling carts placed behind snowbanks.

Walsh today announced that a proposal by Pine Street Inn and The Community Builders, Inc. to create 202 units of supportive and income-restricted housing at\\xa0\\xa03368 Washington Street\\xa0in Jamaica Plain will move forward, following approval from the Boston Planning & Development Agency. The project makes significant progress on Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to end chronic homelessness in the City of Boston.\\xa0\"In Boston, we are committed to making sure that every individual has a place to call home and build a better life,\" said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. \"This project is only possible because of the commitment of Pine Street Inn, The Community Builders, and many partners and stakeholders across the City who have joined our call to bring an end to chronic homelessness.\"The project includes 140 units of supportive housing designated for individuals receiving services from Pine Street Inn. The remaining 62 income-restricted units will be available to low- and moderate-income households with a range of incomes, from less than 30 percent of area median income (AMI), up to 80 percent of AMI. The existing building, currently owned by Pine Street Inn, houses operations and administrative offices that supports the mission of Pine Street Inn, but no shelter beds or housing units. The offices will be temporarily relocated during construction.\"This project represents a major step forward in our efforts to solve homelessness in Boston,\" said Pine Street President Lyndia Downie. \"The number of units in this building will allow us to scale up our housing to a new level, bringing us close to 1,000 units of supportive housing throughout Boston and in Brookline. With the average age of our tenants at 55, this will provide a safe, secure community as they grow older.\"\\xa0The services will be funded by\\xa0Boston\\'s Way Home Fund. Launched by Mayor Walsh in January 2018, Boston\\'s Way Home Fund has a set goal of raising $10 million over four years, to be used to create supportive, sustainable, long-term housing for chronically homeless individuals. The $10 million raised from the fund will allow the City to leverage a significant public and private investment.The project is consistent with the community goals outlined in the BPDA\\'s\\xa0\\xa0PLAN: JP/Rox, approved in 2017, to enhance livability, honor the existing diversity of the neighborhood, use creative design that celebrates the character of the district, and facilitate the creation of more income-restricted housing along the Washington Street corridor.\\xa0Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh proposed dedicating $5 million in new hotel tax revenue towards achieving the City\\'s housing goals. In the first year, $4 million of this new funding is dedicated to the development of supportive housing for formerly homeless individuals through the City\\'s Department of Neighborhood Development.\\xa0###', 'BOSTON - Friday, November 15, 2019\\xa0-\\xa0Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced that the newly-reconstructed Dana Avenue Bridge in Hyde Park will be named the \"Grimké Sisters Bridge\" in honor of Sarah and Angelina Grimké, known for being prominent activists for abolition and women\\'s rights. There will be a public dedication with the Hyde Park Historical Society, Massachusetts Historical Society, Barbara Lee Family Foundation, elected officials, and residents tomorrow, November 16, 2019 at 10:30 a.m.\\xa0\\xa0\"Sarah and Angelina Grimké are perfect examples of what the City of Boston stands for and it is a fitting honor to name this beautiful new bridge after them,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"The Grimké Sisters worked their entire lives so that women and African-Americans had the same rights and privileges as white men, and it is a testament to their hard work and sacrifices that this bridge is built right in the neighborhood they loved and called home.\"\\xa0Daughters of wealthy slaveholders in South Carolina, the Grimké Sisters became nationally known social reformers. Their work was informed by an unwavering belief in the humanity and dignity of all, regardless of race or gender. The sisters moved to the corner of Fairmount Avenue and Highland Street in Hyde Park in 1864, where they lived until their deaths. They were among the first American women to take part in social justice movements.\\xa0They spent time traveling the United States recounting their experiences with slavery on their family\\'s plantation. In 1837, Angelina Grimké became the first woman to address a legislature when she presented a petition to end slavery at the Massachusetts State House. They were early supporters of the women\\'s suffrage movement. In March of 1870, a full 50 years before the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote,\\xa0they led a group of 50 women in Hyde Park to the ballot box, where they cast ballots that would not be counted. The Hyde Park Historical Society houses these ballots in its collection.\"The Hyde Park Historical Society is thrilled that the Grimké Sisters, two of Hyde Park\\'s most distinguished residents, are being honored with the naming of this bridge,\\'\\' said\\xa0Elisa Birdseye from the Hyde Park Historical Society.\\xa0\"Their places in both the abolition and women\\'s suffrage movements are long overdue for recognition and restoration to prominence. It is impossible to overemphasize the role they both played in the struggle for justice in both these fields. A bridge, as a symbol of movement and connection, is a fitting way to honor all they worked for.\"The bridge dedication is part of the\\xa0Greater Boston Women\\'s Vote Centennial, a special project led by the Mayor\\'s Office of Women\\'s Advancement that commemorates 100 years since the 19th Amendment was adopted in 1920, enabling women to vote. This special project is made possible in collaboration with the\\xa0Barbara Lee Family Foundation.\"I am thrilled to see the Grimké sisters receive this special recognition,\" said Barbara Lee, President and Founder of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation. \"What we see and who we see- depicted in our landmarks, and in our town squares - influences how we think about the world. When young girls see women recognized as leaders and heroes, they believe that they too can become leaders and heroes. Thank you to Mayor Marty Walsh, The Mayor\\'s Office of Women\\'s Advancement, and Hyde Park Historic Society for bringing this to fruition.\"The soon-to-be-named Grimké Sisters Bridge spans the Neponset River in Hyde Park and is one of the oldest city-owned bridges left in the City of Boston.

When complete, the $33 million development will preserve the beauty of the original 1899 building, while creating 74 new income-restricted rental units that will be welcoming to seniors 62 years and older, and specifically welcoming to seniors who identify as LGBTQ. All units will be deed-restricted in perpetuity, and will provide affordable, safe housing for seniors across a wide variety of incomes.\"I\\'m proud that together with our partners, we\\'re creating Boston\\'s first designated LGBTQ-supported senior building at the former site of the Rogers Middle School in Hyde Park,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"As Boston\\'s residents continue to age, the need for safe, affordable housing that is welcoming to all remains essential. This new development will be an incredible asset to the neighborhood, offering seniors housing, along with community gardens, walking trails, and other community benefits. I look forward to our work ahead to make more of these projects a reality.\"The $33 million project is being led by Pennrose Development and LGBTQ Senior Housing, Inc. who worked extensively with the local community in Hyde Park to meet the needs of residents.

In addition, 34 units will be available to households earning less than\\xa060% AMI\\xa0(about $55,000 for a two-person household). The remaining units will be rented to households earning up to\\xa080% AMI\\xa0(8 units) and\\xa0\\xa0100% AMI\\xa0(16 units).\\xa0The William Barton Rogers Middle School was built in 1899 on 74,000 square feet of land in Boston\\'s Hyde Park neighborhood. It was named in honor of William Barton Rogers, a geologist, physicist, and educator who was the primary founder and first president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The original building was expanded twice, once in 1920, and then again in 1934. In the more than 100 years of its operation as a Boston Public School, it served as a high school, and then as a middle school. Before its closure in June of 2015, the Rogers School put an emphasis on the performing arts, and the tenet of inclusivity for all.Since the start of the Walsh Administration, over 2,000 units of affordable housing for aging citizens have been preserved as deed restricted affordable units, many of which otherwise would have become market-rate units. The City works to identify and help seniors who are being evicted or foreclosed on and come up with solutions that allow them to remain in their homes or be rapidly rehoused in new housing. Since 2014, the City\\'s program has prevented more than 1,000 of Boston\\'s seniors from losing their housing and becoming homeless.\\xa0In 2018, Mayor Martin J. Walsh updated his comprehensive housing strategy, Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030 to\\xa0increase the City\\'s overall housing goal to 69,000 new units by 2030. This goal includes the creation of 15,820 new income-restricted units, which will elevate Boston\\'s number of income-restricted units to 70,000, while maintaining its ratio of one income-restricted unit in every five units of housing in Boston. Creating 2,000 new units for low-income seniors by 2030 is a specific target within this 15,820 income-restricted unit goal. There are currently 310 units of senior housing in construction, and an additional 350 units, including the 74 at the Barton Rogers School, are in the development pipeline. Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0\\xa02019 housing security legislative package\\xa0focuses on measures to protect Boston\\'s senior renters while expanding upon the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis by strengthening tools that leverage Boston\\'s prosperity and create new sustainable opportunities to make Boston a more inclusive and equitable city.###', 'Mayor Martin J.

Walsh and Boston Public Schools (BPS) Superintendent Brenda Cassellius today joined City officials and BPS staff to celebrate the new playground at the Henry L. Higginson School in Roxbury.Before the construction, the Higginson School was one of two Boston public schools without a playground. The new outdoor play space is the first BPS playground constructed with Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds, through a\\xa0$500,000 grant recommended by Mayor Walsh in 2018.\\xa0The project was the result of advocacy from parents, school staff, community partners, and\\xa0students, who contributed design ideas. Students and families attended a Boston School Committee meeting to advocate for a playground and participated in a subsequent Boston City Council hearing discussing the slate of recommended CPA projects. The project was a public-private partnership between the City, BPS, and Higher Ground, and received unanimous support from the outset from Community Preservation Committee members.\\xa0\"The Higginson is a great school community that reflects the values we believe in the City of Boston,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This school is dedicated to inclusion, and this playground reflects that value by being accessible to different ages and different abilities. This is exactly the type of improvement in our infrastructure that Community Preservation Act funds are intended to provide.\"The school\\'s previous outdoor space consisted solely of a cracked, uneven concrete surface in need of repair. The new playground is two-tiered with each level supporting play for students of different ages. There are structures on both tiers, including rubber-surfaced play areas, slides, climbing ropes, modern seesaws and an adjustable basketball hoop with a paved court.The Higginson School serves pre-Kindergarten through second-grade students with and without disabilities in a fully inclusive setting. The new outdoor space has\\xa0features\\xa0including a ramp connecting both levels of the playground to make the area accessible for all students.\"All of our students deserve an outdoor space where they can engage in physical activity and have fun with their peers,\" said BPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius. \"I\\'m so appreciative of our community and City partners who collaborated with students, staff and families to bring the school community\\'s vibrant ideas to life. Student voice and community preservation are incredibly vital, and I thank the City of Boston for making both a priority.\"During the event, it was announced that a proposal will be set forth to the Boston School Committee to dedicate the playground to retiring Higginson School Principal Marie Mullen. Mullen is stepping down as school leader after more than 35 years of service to the BPS community. She has held various BPS roles, including teacher and director of instruction, at multiple BPS schools including the Mozart Elementary, Trotter K-8, and Haynes Early Education Center. She was previously the principal of the now-closed Fifield Elementary School in Dorchester.\"It\\'s always wonderful when we can provide our youth with a new addition to their school building that was designed with their own ideas in mind,\" said Boston School Committee Chairperson Michael Loconto. \"I thank Principal Marie Mullen for her decades of service to the BPS community and I am so glad that we were able to celebrate this playground, the school community, and her leadership ahead of her retirement.\"The Community Preservation Fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017 after voters adopted the measure in November 2016. The\\xa0last round\\xa0of CPA awards in February 2019 funded $34 million to projects across the city, including affordable housing developments and programs, parks and open space, and historic preservation projects consistent with statewide guidelines.\\xa0As part of his\\xa02019 legislative agenda, Mayor Walsh has been advocating for adjusting the surcharge on fees for recording deeds to increase the State CPA match, protecting the Act that more than 170 cities and towns depend on for the creation of affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation. When municipalities voted to enact CPA, they did so with the promise of a substantial state match. This year, the match was just 11 percent with a one-time surplus allotment added, but the CPA bill people voted for is no longer the same bill. The FY20 State budget increases the match, raising an estimated additional $36 million in revenue, putting the state match at around 30 percent and allowing us to invest more in our communities.About Boston Public SchoolsThe Boston Public Schools (BPS), the birthplace of public education in the United States, serves nearly 55,000 pre-kindergarten through grade 12 students in 125 schools. BPS is committed to transforming the lives of all children through exemplary teaching in a world-class system of innovative, welcoming schools. We partner with the community, families, and students to develop in every learner the knowledge, skill, and character to excel in college, career, and life.About the Community Preservation Act (CPA)After Boston voters adopted the CPA in November 2016, the City created a Community Preservation Fund. This fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017. The City uses this revenue to fund initiatives consistent with statewide CPA guidelines: affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and public recreation. The funding of any project requires a recommendation from the Community Preservation Committee and appropriation by the City.

The Tuition-Free Community College program (TFCC) was launched by Mayor Walsh in 2016, and pays for up to three years of college for Boston\\'s income-eligible students who have earned their high school credential. Massasoit joins Bunker Hill Community College, Roxbury Community College, MassBay Community College and Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology as participants in the program.\\xa0\"I launched our Tuition-Free Community College Plan as a tool to help Boston residents afford and complete college,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Since then, we have kept pushing toward that goal by growing the program-expanding student choice, academic opportunities and access to institutions committed to student success. Massasoit Community College will be a valuable partner in our work to build career pathways for Boston residents.\"Through the TFCC program, Massasoit will provide participants with more options in both locations and programs of study. Massasoit operates campuses in Middleborough, Brockton and Canton, which is within 10 miles of Hyde Park and Mattapan. The addition of Massasoit also makes new associate degree programs available to TFCC program students in Diesel Technology, Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning (HVAC), Veterinary Technology and Architectural Technology.These fields lead to careers that pay well above Boston\\'s living wage. For example, diesel mechanics and HVAC technicians in the Greater Boston area earn salaries of approximately $60,000 on average, at an average wage of $29/hour, compared to the current living wage of approximately $15/hour.

We hope that through the Age Strong @ Work series we are not only able to help those on a path to employment but also showcase the value of older workers to employers across the region.”\\xa0The series was developed in collaboration between the Age Strong Commission, the Mayor’s Office of Economic Development, Mayor’s Office of Diversity, Mayor\\'s Office of Workforce Development, and the Disabilities Commission. The City of Boston also brought in a number of community partners, including funding partner AARP Massachusetts, Operation ABLE, Jobcase, and others to provide meaningful information and expertise about Boston’s job market to older participants.Rob Quinn, 60, of the South End, participated in the Age Strong @ Work series. “I am grateful for the opportunity afforded me to not only attend, but more importantly share my employment experiences – struggles and successes,” said Quinn. “Being valued for my lived experience is what gives me a pulse and continued meaning and purpose in the city of Boston.”\\xa0The employment series for older workers was created in response to Age-Friendly listening sessions in every neighborhood of Boston.

Walsh today announced an Executive Order designed to support equitable procurement in the City of Boston. This Executive Order builds on the 2016 Executive Order, and the Walsh Administration\\'s policies and initiatives to address racial and economic disparities in order to expand opportunities for woman- and minority-owned businesses.\"As Mayor, my goal is to make sure that Boston is a city of opportunity for everyone. We need to harness our City\\'s incredible economic growth so that it lifts everyone up,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"To have a truly strong city, Boston\\'s success must be shared by all. The City\\'s own spending power is a key lever for increasing equity in business opportunities, and this Executive Order is the next step in ensuring we match our business practices with our values and goals.\"Mayor Walsh\\'s Executive Order will work to ensure the full participation of all enterprises in City spending, focused on small and local, minority-, women-, and veteran- owned small businesses.\\xa0The Executive Order has three key aspects:\\xa0In order to make procurement opportunities more accessible to a wider audience, the Department of Innovation and Technology and the Procurement Department will also update the City\\'s procurement website so that businesses are able to view and filter all city contracts and opportunities.\"This Executive Order establishes a set of sound business practices in the City of Boston\\'s procurement process that will increase transparency, accessibility, and efficiency across all departments and agencies,\" said John F. Barros, Chief of Economic Development. \"As we create equitable procurement plans in the beginning of the budgeting process, while simultaneously modernizing our certified business registry, the City will be in a position to strategically market opportunities to an increased pool of businesses and do business with a diverse ecosystem of new businesses.\"\"As the Chief Procurement Officer for the City of Boston, I\\'m confident this Executive Order will give the City more tools to ensure we\\'re using Boston\\'s resources to empower all residents and businesses,\" said Emme Handy, Chief Financial Officer. \"This Executive Order focuses on real solutions to better equip our departments and employees to achieve Boston\\'s goals of an equitable and diverse procurement process.\"\"I support Mayor Walsh and the City of Boston\\'s efforts to make the procurement process more inclusive and efficient for all, and to ultimately increase contracting with minority-owned local businesses. Contracting with the City has positively impacted my business, and I look forward to the implementation of such process changes resulting in more transparency and accountability, and opening more opportunities for City Fresh and other small minority companies,\" said Sheldon Lloyd, CEO, City Fresh Foods.In coordination with the implementation of this Executive Order, Mayor Walsh also established the City of Boston\\'s first-ever Supplier Diversity Advisory Council. A team of leaders in both the public and private sectors, this group brings expertise in supplier diversity best practices, technical assistance, community economic development, and equity programs to work alongside Mayor\\'s Office staff and make policy and programming recommendations. Supplier Diversity Advisory Council members include:\"The City of Boston is taking an important first step towards advancing equity and access for minority, women and veteran-owned businesses by implementing the Executive Order, and conducting a disparity study in City procurement. Black, Latino and women entrepreneurs are fueling small-business growth in the City of Boston, yet are often overlooked and left out of procurement opportunities. We thank Mayor Walsh and John Barros, Chief of Economic Development for recognizing the systemic barriers facing these local businesses and implementing processes, systems and reporting to provide more equitable contracting opportunities that help level the playing field,\" said Betty Francisco, Co-Founder, Amplify LatinX.\\xa0This Executive Order is one of several steps towards creating a more equitable, transparent procurement process across City of Boston departments. The Mayor\\'s Office of Economic Development is currently leading a\\xa0Disparity Study\\xa0in collaboration with BBC Research & Consulting. The Disparity Study will examine the participation of MWBEs in City contracting, measure the availability of MWBEs for City contracts and procurements, and assess marketplace conditions for MWBEs.\\xa0Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh launched the\\xa0Economic Development Center\\xa0in January, establishing a new foundation to deploy small business resources into every neighborhood and across all industries, working to further strengthen professional relationships, and ensure a diverse vendor pipeline. The Equity and Inclusion series offers topical workshops to share knowledge about the City\\'s procurement process, convenes top contracting departments and small businesses across the city in workshops for networking, training, and certification. The Pathways to City Contracting series hosted over 450 attendees across five workshops where staff walked attendees through the certification and bidding process, expanded the vendor pool, and created partnerships amongst businesses and city departments. The City Contracting Opportunity Fairs are designed for department buyers to meet local business owners, and foster fruitful relationships between the City of Boston and MBEs, WBEs, small and local, and veteran-owned small businesses. Targeted community-based info sessions for specific contracts have also resulted in MBEs and MWBEs landing contracts for the first time in landscaping, snow removal, and recycling cart delivery.This summer, the City of Boston and Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) were selected to participate in the Citi Foundation and Living Cities\\' expansion of the\\xa0City Accelerator initiative on Inclusive Procurement,\\xa0an effort to increase participation and opportunities for MWBEs in City procurement. As one of ten cities participating, Boston will receive technical assistance, resources, and share best practices with cities across the country on improving procurement practices.Mayor Walsh will participate in a ceremonial signing of the Executive Order next Friday during the inaugural meeting of the Supplier Diversity Advisory Council.', 'On October 30, a coalition of seven Boston organizations joined together to celebrate the re-installation of the statue with recitations, songs, and bagpipes in the spirit of the statue’s original dedication ceremony held on January 1, 1920.\\xa0 The event was sponsored by the Boston Parks and Recreation Department, City of Boston Office of Arts and Culture, Millennium Partners, Fenway Civic Association, Fenway Alliance, The National Trust for Scotland Foundation USA, Emerald Necklace Conservancy, and Samuels & Associates.Speakers included Harriet Cross (UK Consul General to New England), Karin Goodfellow (City of Boston Arts Commissioner), and Boston Parks Commissioner Ryan Woods. Scottish singer Maureen McMullan performed two Burns poems accompanied by roots music students from Berklee College of Music. Robert Creighton and Scottish author Jeremy W. Bell recited Burns poetry, including, \"A Man’s a Man and Scots wha Hae.\"The statue of Robert Burns and his faithful dog, Luath, was created by sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson in 1920 and originally situated in the Back Bay Fens near sculptor Daniel Chester French’s monument to Irish poet John Boyle O’Reilly. The juxtaposition of the two works was deliberate and meant to recognize Scottish and Irish literary tradition in a pastoral setting reminiscent of their work.\\xa0 The sculpture was moved to Winthrop Square in 1975 and after a prolonged community effort was finally returned to its rightful place in the Fens on October 30, 2019.Poet Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a working-class Scot who became a pioneer of Romantic literature. His work includes themes of republicanism, patriotism, class, gender, and poverty. He has inspired American politicians and authors like Abraham Lincoln, John Steinbeck, and JD Salinger. Burns remains an enduring cultural icon for Scots around the world most famously, his \"Auld Lang Syne\" is sung each New Year’s Eve.', 'BOSTON - Wednesday, October 30, 2019 - Mayor Martin J.

Walsh this morning joined the owners of We Grow Microgreens, elected officials, and community members to celebrate Hyde Park\\'s newest small business, which will bring healthy greens to grocery stores, restaurants, and farmers markets across the City. The urban farm was made possible thanks to land made available by Boston\\'s Department of Neighborhood Development and Community Preservation funds.\\xa0\"I am proud of the City of Boston\\'s commitment to the revitalization of this vacant land, creating a new farm and a new gathering space that all of Hyde Park can enjoy,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I want to thank the owners of We Grow Microgreens for investing in Readville and their community. The involvement of many partners brought a new business, a new community resource, and a new farm and new life to this empty space.\"Along with an acre of land, Boston\\'s Department of Neighborhood Development (DND) also provided technical assistance to support the revitalization of the property with the greenhouse, hoop houses, and improved public access. The City included a permanent agricultural restriction on the deed to prevent the possibility of future development as anything other than an urban farm. Through its Grassroots program, DND assists those working in their community to increase local food growing opportunities and neighborhood open space.\\xa0\"We are so grateful to forward-thinking Boston for recognizing the importance of growing food within the City limits,\" said Microgreens owners Lisa Evans and Tim Smith. \"A farm is a significant feature for the City of Boston. We will produce the highest quality microgreens and edible flowers in order to help Boston fulfill its mission of supporting urban farming and increasing access to healthy, locally grown produce.\"Last year, Boston awarded $134,700 in Community Preservation funds to We Grow Microgreens to create a public path to mitigate stormwater runoff and connect neighbors to the site. The Community Preservation Fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017 after voters adopted the measure in November 2016. The\\xa0last round\\xa0of CPA awards in February 2019 funded $34 million to projects across the city, including affordable housing developments and programs, parks and open space, and historic preservation projects consistent with statewide guidelines.\\xa0\"I am pleased the state can partner with the City of Boston and the Walsh Administration to provide community preservation as well as healthy, locally grown food options for our residents,\" said State Senator Mike Rush (D-Norfolk & Suffolk District). \"It is especially important to identify open space in our communities for such programs to occur.\"\\xa0\\xa0The Massachusetts Department of Agriculture Resources (MDAR) Urban Farming Program provided $60,000 for the purchase and installation of a commercial greenhouse.\"Massachusetts\\' Urban Agriculture Program supports farming organizations, such as We Grow Microgreens, to strengthen urban neighborhoods by leveraging opportunities through the production, processing, marketing and sale of fresh food at the local level,\" said MDAR Commissioner John Lebeaux. \"We are thrilled to support community partners invested in creating greater access to nutritious, fresh food.\"Mayor Walsh recently released a\\xa0Food Access Agenda\\xa0to assess existing food access initiatives and deliver actionable recommendations to fill gaps, including supporting urban farming in the City of Boston. Urban farming gives residents better access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food, while cutting down on transportation costs and carbon emissions. The Agenda will guide the City\\'s work to ensure everyone has equitable access to affordable, fresh, healthy, and culturally-connected foods and end food insecurity in Boston by 2030.\\xa0As part of his\\xa02019 legislative agenda, Mayor Walsh has been advocating for adjusting the surcharge on fees for recording deeds to increase the State CPA match, protecting the Act that more than 170 cities and towns depend on for the creation of affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation. When municipalities voted to enact CPA, they did so with the promise of a substantial state match. This year, the match was just 11 percent with a one-time surplus allotment added, but the CPA bill people voted for is no longer the same bill. The FY20 State budget increases the match, raising an estimated additional $36 million in revenue, putting the state match at around 30 percent and allowing us to invest more in our communities.About the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND)The Department of Neighborhood Development (DND) works with communities to improve Boston\\'s neighborhoods through investing public resources. DND\\'s main jobs are to create housing options, support tenants, foster homeownership, end homelessness, and manage the City\\'s real estate.\\xa0About the Community Preservation Action (CPA)After Boston voters adopted the CPA in November 2016, the City created a Community Preservation Fund. This fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017. The City uses this revenue to fund initiatives consistent with statewide CPA guidelines: affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and public recreation. The funding of any project requires a recommendation from the Community Preservation Committee and appropriation by the City.

Some of the funding will also be used for identifying and remediating multiple housing-related health and safety hazards that are not lead-based paint hazards as part of a comprehensive approach.These grants are provided through HUD\\'s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes to identify and clean up dangerous lead in privately-owned low-income housing. The funding is part of a $319 million competitive HUD funding round which was awarded to 77 city, county and state governments. The new funds will protect families by targeting low-income homes with significant lead and/or other home health and safety hazards.Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead and can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects, particularly affecting the development of the brain and nervous system, according to the World Health Organization.\\xa0Most children with elevated blood lead levels are exposed through the paint in their homes, especially if their homes were built before the use of lead paint was prohibited in 1978. Four in five homes in Boston were built before 1980, meaning that many children may live in homes with lead paint, according to the\\xa0American Community Survey (ACS). In 2017, less than 2 percent of children under the age of four had elevated blood lead levels.According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the percentage of screened children with elevated blood lead levels in Boston has declined 98 percent since 1992. However, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, attention, and academic achievement in children. It is imperative that parents of small children have annual checkups scheduled where the children\\'s blood is tested.\\xa0\\xa0\"By providing these grants, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for the community is a priority. A key part of having a healthy home is maintaining your own health,\" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD\\'s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. \"HUD is committed to protecting families from these hazards and providing healthy and sustainable housing.\"The City of Boston\\'s home-based lead poisoning prevention efforts are led by the Department of Neighborhood Development and the Boston Public Health Commission, in partnership with the Boston Office of Fair Housing and Equity, Suffolk County Housing Court and a range of medical, community development, code enforcement, and lead paint advocacy partners who share the goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning in Boston.\\xa0By receiving this award, Boston will ramp up its efforts to continue to be a\\xa0national leader in keeping lead out of drinking water supplies. The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) has offered ratepayers financial assistance to replace private lead service pipes since 1996, a grant program whose financial assistance incentives were doubled in 2015.\\xa0\"NOAH is really fortunate to have such a strong and important partner in our work as DND and the Lead Safe Boston program! So many older buildings have lead in various forms and East Boston has many young and growing families,\" said Executive Director of NOAH Philip Giffee. \"it\\'s critical that the City support the families by providing funds to get rid of the lead hazard. We could not do it from our regular budgets. \"\\xa0In order to further support Boston\\'s efforts in preventing exposure to lead, Mayor Walsh has been advocating for \"An Act relative to lead abatement\" sponsored\\xa0by Representative Angelo Scaccia proposing to increase the tax credit from $1,500 to $3,000 for the containment or abatement of lead paint to further protect children from lead paint contamination. This bill would help homeowners in Boston mitigate the expenses associated with the removal of lead from their homes and further encourage the important work that needs to be done to protect the youngest residents of the City.Residents who are worried about lead paint in their home should visit the\\xa0Boston Home Center\\xa0website and or call (617) 635-HOME.###', \"Representatives of the Boston Parks and Recreation Department and Friends of the East Boston Greenway celebrated the renaming of the Greenway in honor of the late community activist Mary Ellen Welch.\\xa0Welch, who passed away at age 77 on March 7 of this year, was a lifelong local resident, beloved second grade school teacher for 47 ½ years at the O’Donnell Elementary School, and preeminent community activist and mentor who either founded, led, or served on the board of some of the most influential community groups in East Boston.In addition to countless other neighborhood improvement projects, Mary Ellen Welch played a key role in\\xa0identifying an abandoned railroad line as the perfect place for a protected walking and biking path and new parkland connecting neighborhood residents to Boston Harbor and Constitution Beach.\\xa0\\xa0As one of the founders of the East Boston Greenway Council and the Friends, Welch, together with her neighbors, worked for decades on mitigation for parkland lost to Logan Airport, leading to the creation and extension of the Greenway through the cooperative efforts of the Boston Parks and Recreation Department and the Boston Natural Areas Network (BNAN).\\xa0“She represented our best values,” said Mayor Martin J.

Walsh today announced that the Boston Public Library (BPL) is eliminating overdue fines for youth under the age of 18 who have a Boston Public Library card. The announcement follows a unanimous vote from the BPL Board of Trustees to eliminate overdue fines which in turn will also remove barriers and expand access to the important services and resources offered at the library for all youth in the City of Boston.\"The accrual of fines puts a barrier between youth and the Library that can prevent future use of its materials, programming, and resources,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"In Boston, we believe that free and open access to the Library is crucial for children\\'s literacy and education. Going \\'fine free\\' is a step to level the playing field and become closer to ensuring that everyone has access to the important resources the Library provides.\"Under this new policy change, which becomes effective November 1, 2019, BPL will remove all pending overdue fines and replacement costs for youth library card holders. Youth card holders will not face monetary penalties for returning books late, although they will still be required to return any overdue books in order to check out additional materials. While youth card holders will no longer incur fines for late returns, they will still be responsible for replacement costs if a book is lost or not returned.With this move, the Boston Public Library now joins the five percent of public libraries that do not charge late fines for youth materials, according to\\xa0a recent Library Journal survey. The same survey reported that, on average, only about 14 percent of borrowed materials are returned late. Previously, at the Boston Public Library, the maximum overdue fine a youth card holder could accrue was $2.50 per book.\"We\\'re proud to be joining the ranks of libraries across the country who are moving towards being fine-free,\" said BPL President David Leonard. \"Too often, fines penalize those least able to afford them and have the unintended effect of turning young people, in particular, away from their libraries. That\\'s just not what \\'Free To All\\' should mean in the 21st\\xa0century. Eliminating youth fines reflects core values of the BPL - to be accessible, to be welcoming, and to ensure we are promoting youth reading, not preventing it.\"In FY19, the Library collected a total of $24,069 in overdue fines from BPL cardholders under the age of 18, representing less than ten percent of the total youth overdue fine balance for that fiscal year, which was approximately $249,179. That data indicates that about 90 percent of BPL cardholders below the age of 18 are facing fines - and therefore barriers - to continued use of the Library.\"Libraries are our societies\\' most trusted public institutions - we are in the business of opening doors, not creating barriers for children and families,\" said Susan Benton, President & CEO of the Urban Libraries Council, which monitors and reports on libraries going \\'fine free\\' through an\\xa0interactive map\\xa0on its website. \"By joining libraries across North America in eliminating overdue fines for children and teen readers, Boston Public Library is taking a leading stance in ensuring all city youth have equitable opportunities to pursue their dreams.\"More than 150,000 youth hold BPL library cards, while thousands more benefit from the BPL\\'s free\\xa0programs,\\xa0Homework Help sessions, annual summer reading challenge, and\\xa0other outreach programs. In January, the Youth Services department welcomed a new Youth Outreach Librarian, responsible for extending BPL services and programs into the community, especially to underserved and underrepresented populations. The Youth Outreach Librarian works collaboratively with partners including South Cove Community Health Center, the Floating Hospital for Children, and Boston Children\\'s Hospital.The Library has also expanded its outreach partnerships with organizations serving teens.

As I walked into the Mather Elementary, I saw a sign that proudly distinguished the school as the oldest elementary school in the United States. It felt fitting that today would be the first day that things got shaken up a bit in the cafeteria, with the rollout of My Way Cafe, a new cafeteria model that allows students to choose what they want for lunch.\\xa0On the menu: nachos. Students had the option to have either corn tortilla chips or brown rice with black beans or ground, seasoned beef. Then, students could pick from salsa, cheese, and jalapenos to top their meal, and then choose any of the vegetables from the salad bar to round out their meal.\\xa0The change-up made for a bit of chaos and confusion, especially with younger students who could not always make up their minds quickly. But the staff and teachers were patient, and helped move students through the line.\\xa0Sitting down at tables, students were audibly pleased with their new school lunches. Some students asked, “Do we get this every day?” They gave me big high fives when I told them that they would be getting fresh food like this every day. Another girl asked, “How much does it cost?” She gave me a big smile when I told her that school lunch is free for all students.\\xa0The lunch monitors in particular noticed that students were eating more of their meals than before, and appreciated the variety of vegetables available for students to eat. One boy exclaimed, “Wow, we have a real chef in here now!” He was eager to know what was on the menu tomorrow.\\xa0This year, the My WayCafe model is expanding to Boston Public Schools in Dorchester and South Boston. Check out the MyWayCafe website for more information about the rollouts and the monthly menu.\\xa0This post was written by Leilani Stacy, a FoodCorps\\xa0AmeriCorps Service Member at the Blackstone Innovation Elementary School.', 'BOSTON - Monday, October 21, 2019 - Mayor Martin J. Walsh today joined the Elizabeth Stone House, the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation (MHIC) and the Women\\'s Institute for Housing and Economic Development for a topping off ceremony of the new headquarters for the Elizabeth Stone House, a nonprofit organization serving survivors of domestic violence. The mixed-use building will have 32 units of affordable rental housing and will provide additional services to more than 2,000 individuals each year through a licensed childcare center and space to expand its services and community programming.\\xa0\"Everybody deserves a safe place to live, and a place to call home,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"The Elizabeth Stone House provides a valuable and essential safe space for victims of domestic violence. I want to thank all partners involved for their dedication in bringing this project to life that will allow the Elizabeth House to save even more lives.\"The project will be a five-story 56,500-square-foot building at the corner of Westminster Avenue and Washington Street in Roxbury, comprised of 32 affordable housing rental units on the three upper floors. The first and ground floors will contain a licensed childcare center, offices for administrative and service work, and several programming rooms. The new Elizabeth Stone House is expected to open in late summer of 2020.\\xa0\"This new building is by far the single biggest accomplishment since coming to the Elizabeth Stone House in 1998,\" said Nancy Owens Hess, the agency\\'s executive director. \"Our organization has helped thousands of families over the years but have always been constrained by space. Our new home will allow us to make a much bigger difference in the lives of our families and the surrounding community. We could never have achieved our goal without the encouragement and support of all of our partners in the project.\"The month of October is National Domestic Violence Awareness month. In 2018, the Boston Police Department reported making 19,000 service calls for domestic violence incidents, nearly half of which were in Boston neighborhoods that will be served by the new Elizabeth Stone House headquarters. Jane Doe Inc. reported that in Massachusetts in 2018, one in three women and one in five men reported having experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.The Elizabeth Stone House was established in 1974 as a residential alternative to institutionalization of women with mental illness. Over time, the nonprofit expanded its footprint by opening a domestic violence shelter and a transitional housing facility. Elizabeth Stone House was the first transitional housing center in the U.S. for women affected by domestic violence, mental illness, and substance abuse.\\xa0The Elizabeth Stone House currently helps adults and children survivors of domestic violence stabilize their personal lives, strengthen their families, take control of their finances, and find a safe place to live. The nonprofit currently serves approximately 500 adults and 350 children annually, providing them with housing, advocacy and access to programs and services.\"The work that Elizabeth Stone House does is monumental. We are pleased to play a major part in helping the Elizabeth Stone House build this new facility where it can do an even better job at helping people turn their lives around,\" said Joe Flatley, MHIC president.This new development was made possible in part from a $2.1 million grant from the City of Boston, along with other partners including the Massachusetts Housing and Investment Corporation,TD Bank North, the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Early Education and Out of School Time Grant, Boston Private, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Affordable Housing Program.

The $10.2 million renovation will reconfigure and update of the interior of the building, providing a larger community room with updated AV equipment, a quiet reading room, a dedicated teen space with two small study rooms, and an outdoor reading terrace. Construction will begin in the coming weeks and will conclude in 2021.\"The Roslindale branch library is one of our busiest and most-loved libraries in Boston, and I\\'m proud we are able to invest in making this community space an even better home to all,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"To the community: this is your library. Our incredible partners have made this work possible, and I look forward to the entire community enjoying this space.\"\\xa0The design process, launched in fiscal year 2017, is led by Leers Weinzapfel Associates in partnership with the BPL, the City of Boston\\'s Public Facilities Department, and the community. The design process was informed by a community programming study and a community review process completed in 2013.The project is a complete renovation and transformation of the entire 1960\\'s library into a 21st century library and community space. The new welcoming entry, semi-circular open reading space, redesigned community room, reading room, and conference room, and computer stations, along with an urban reading garden will revitalize this important community resource, will provide community members with an inspiring place to learn and gather.\"We\\'re grateful to Mayor Walsh for his continued significant investments in the BPL. Each branch renovation we complete strengthens the neighborhood it serves,\" said BPL President David Leonard. \"This continuing transformation of the library system means that the BPL spaces will be better able to serve all of our residents, wherever they are in life, connecting them with resources they may need, whether that\\'s an ESL class, a job skills workshop, or simply a recommendation for their next favorite book, and as always, a community hub that is free to all.\"The renovation will include new roofing new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and a completely reconfigured interior that takes advantage of the historical features of the library\\'s original design, such as the central dome with clerestory lighting. A new central point circulation desk under the dome will provide easier access to library staff for patrons. The semi-circular shaped open reading space will provide greater overall visibility while keeping separate areas for adults, teens, and children.\\xa0All aspects of the library will be made accessible including the new canopy covered entry, which eliminates outside steps and ramps and provides universal access to the library at grade for all members of the public. Once inside, a gently sloped walkway leads patrons to the library\\'s main spaces. A new elevator will make the existing basement space accessible to library staff and will also include storage spaces for community organizations such as the library\\'s Friends group and the Roslindale Historical Society.A bright, multi-colored entry wall of terracotta baguettes will maintain the library\\'s iconic blue color scheme while representing the diversity of the neighborhood and alluding to the shelved books inside, waiting for eager readers. An intimate reading garden, slightly elevated from the street level, with a wood deck and seating, sheltered by landscaping and fencing, will provide a pleasant outdoor reading area in the midst of the busy center of the Roslindale community.While the Roslindale Branch is closed for renovations, it welcomes patrons to go to the nearby Jamaica Plain Branch, the Hyde Park Branch, and the West Roxbury Branch. In addition, The Friends of the Roslindale Branch also started a \"Little Free Libraries\" initiative to keep books available in the neighborhood during construction.Mayor Walsh\\'s FY2020 capital budget invests more than $127 million over the next five years to reimagine Boston\\'s branch libraries and critical departments at the Central Library in Copley Square.###', 'BOSTON - Saturday, October 19, 2019 - Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Boston Public Schools (BPS) Superintendent Brenda Cassellius, students, teachers and community members gathered today for a ribbon cutting to celebrate the brand new Eliot K-8 School building at 585 Commercial Street in the North End, a $40 million investment in Boston Public Schools.\\xa0\"I am thrilled to celebrate\\xa0the opening of a new Eliot School building,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This school is a big part of the North End\\'s history, and will remain the heart and soul of this community for decades to come. Thank you to all our partners who made this possible, I look forward to all our students, teachers, families and the entire BPS community enjoying this beautiful building.\"Construction for the Upper School renovation project began in 2017. The renovation of this building, along with an earlier renovation project at the Salem Street building, represent a $40 million expenditure. The two projects are key investments for the North End community, and are reflective of the City of Boston and BPS\\'s commitment to provide innovative, modern learning environments to students.The Eliot K-8 School now consists of three facilities, all in the North End. The Lower School, located at 16 Charter Street, serves pre-K, Kindergarten and first-grade students the Intermediate School at 173 Salem Street serves students in grades 2-4 and the recently completed Upper School at 585 Commercial Street serves students in grades 5-8.The new, 42,000-square-foot Commercial Street facility opened in September. Interior and site improvements include a digital art studio, a technology classroom with robotics lab and laser cutter, media center, and 18 new classrooms that promote collaborative learning. The building also features eight brightly colored projecting bays, which create \"learning nooks\" geared for small group instruction and collaborative learning. Exterior upgrades include a new schoolyard with play structure and a brand new roof. The building also features a multi-purpose space that may be utilized by the community.The renovations of both the Commercial Street and Salem Street campuses were designed by the Boston-based firm Finegold Alexander Architects. Daniel O\\'Connell\\'s Sons were the contractor for the project. Design and construction of the project was managed by the City of Boston Public Facilities Department.\"Every student deserves access to a 21st century education and Boston Public Schools is committed to providing all of our youth with safe, joyful and innovative learning environments,\" said BPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius. \"This is an exciting time for the Eliot School, and demonstrates the immense value and strength of coordinated community engagement and collaboration for the benefit of our children.\"\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Numerous building features promote sustainability and resiliency, including a new reflective roof, high-efficiency boilers and new glazing that maximizes natural light. Other mechanical improvements include a new electrical system and fire and alarm protection systems. The cafeteria will also feature the My Way Cafe school meals program, which provides students with fresh, healthy food options.\"It\\'s incredible that our students are learning about American history and social studies with a view of the Bunker Hill Monument and the U.S.S. Constitution,\" said Boston School Committee Chairperson Michael Loconto.\\xa0\"This beautiful new building will facilitate hands-on, collaborative learning experiences for our students and will undoubtedly serve as a model for future BPS construction projects.\"\\xa0The new campus is located on the Harborwalk, providing rear access to the building, and is also a short distance to public parks and all of the historic North End, with nearby MBTA access via North Station. The two other Eliot School campuses are also within walking distance, with students frequently traveling from one building to the others throughout the school day.The Eliot\\'s 730 students are evenly distributed among the three school buildings, with the Upper School currently serving nearly 250 students.\\xa0The Eliot School has experienced renewal under Principal Traci Walker Griffith\\'s 12 years of leadership, transforming the school into a thriving, deeply connected K-8 school community. Walker Griffith credits her holistic approach-serving children academically, socially, and emotionally-and the help of a committed teaching staff, dedicated student families and an engaged community.\\xa0\"The opening of the new Upper School is a true testament to our community\\'s and the City of Boston\\'s belief in public education and commitment to the Eliot School\\'s expansion,\" said Principal Walker Griffith. \"Every day our students, families, and faculty enter a magical, state-of-the-art building where they engage in learning and experiences on their path to being the change agents of the future. As the proud principal of the Eliot School, I am forever grateful for a community deeply rooted in the mission that a great education can transform students\\' lives.\"The Eliot School is the oldest continuously-run school in the United States and has been located in the North End for its entire history. The school opened as the North Writing School in 1713 and has educated many famous Bostonians, including Samuel Adams and Paul Revere.The Eliot School investment builds on Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to improving Boston Public Schools across the city. This summer alone, BPS completed projects at nearly 50 schools, often in conjunction with the City\\'s Public Facilities Department, including construction in 29 schools to expand the My Way Cafe program.In the past six years Mayor Walsh has strengthened the City\\'s relationship with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA), resulting in an unprecedented amount of collaborative work, leveraging over $100 million in reimbursement for projects like the new Dearborn 6-12 STEM Academy in Roxbury, renovation of Boston Arts Academy in the Fenway, and future projects at the Josiah Quincy Upper School and the Carter School in the South End. In addition, the City has been approved for 27 repair projects at various BPS schools since 2015 to create more energy efficient buildings by replacing roofs, windows and boilers.About Boston Public SchoolsThe Boston Public Schools (BPS), the birthplace of public education in the United States, serves nearly 55,000 pre-kindergarten through grade 12 students in 125 schools.

In 1903, the Department of Commerce took over the operation of the Census.The 1790 Census resulted in a nationwide population count of 3.9 million. That number included slaves counted as three-fifths of a whole person. Altogether, this population count was lower than leaders of the era — George Washington and Thomas Jefferson among them — expected. Questions of accuracy would prove to be a recurring theme. As a result, the modern decennial Censuses include procedures to check the accuracy of the count.There have been a total of 22 censuses since the 1790 Census. These were often undertaken with very different counting methods and question wording. Most recently, Census 2010 was mailed to every home in America. Census 2010 reported a national count of 308 million people in one of the most accurate censuses to date. Since its inception, the Federal Census has had a huge impact and influence on American life.Data from the United States Census is at the very heart of American representative democracy. This has been true ever since the Census was ratified as part of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Population data is used to set up political representation at all levels of government:Census population counts determine how many seats in the House a state receives. Once determined, states draw their own district boundaries using Census data. In 2010, for example, Massachusetts lost a congressional seat (from 10 seats to 9), while Florida gained two (25 to 27).Seats are drawn for state legislative and senatorial districts using Census data.Cities and towns use Census data to draw internal political boundaries, like wards and districts.The richness of Census data allows the federal government to distribute funding for some of the country’s most critical social programs. Funds are directed toward those people with the greatest need. Most Census-guided funding to Massachusetts is allocated through one of the three systems below:Formula grants are allocated to states through formulas that typically target greater funding to areas or populations with greater need. The largest example of this type is Medicaid. This program provides health insurance coverage to low-income families and individuals.Unlike formula grants, project grants fund specific projects for fixed periods of time. These can include anything from scholarship funding to construction grants. The Head Start/Early Head Start programs are examples of this type of grant.Direct payments are made to individuals, private firms or institutions for a particular activity or in support of a particular program. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is one such program.Aside from the decennial Census, researchers make use of another Census Bureau product — the American Community Survey — to understand the makeup of America. From 1970 to 2000, the decennial Census included two questionnaires. The first, the short-form Census, was distributed to almost every household in America. The second was the long-form Census. The was distributed to the remaining one in six American residences that did not receive the short-form.More complex and time consuming, the long-form Census gave researchers a more nuanced understanding of the population. It did so by asking more questions of a representative sample of the population. The long-form Census also extrapolated those answers across the United States as a whole. The questions included ones about languages spoken at home, as well as educational and employment situations (among other areas).The 2000 Census was the last decennial Census to feature a long-form questionnaire. In 2005, those questions were moved over to its replacement, the American Community Survey. This survey, which takes place each year, allows fine-grained analysis of all Census-designated geographies. This includes the nation as a whole down to geographies as small as several City blocks.Together, the American Community Survey and decennial Census help us understand a changing America. State and local governments use the Bureau’s data to help plan for population growth. Businesses use it to understand their local markets and to consider plans for expansion. In the nonprofit world, Census data are used to find vulnerable populations. Social scientists and pollsters use Census data to design sample methodology to better understand what the American public is thinking.All told, Census data is used in many different ways.', 'Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced that three Boston non-profit organizations - La Alianza Hispana, Mujeres Unidas Avanzando, and South End Technology Center - \\xa0will receive $100,000 in grants combined through the City of Boston\\'s Digital Equity Fund.

We look forward to these organizations improving residents\\' lives, and creating more opportunities for all.\"La Alianza Hispana vows to empower individuals and strengthen the Latino community by leveraging partnerships to provide social, educational, and health services, and technology resources.Mujeres Unidas Avanzado focuses on helping Latinas who have been on the outskirts of society-whether low-income, formerly incarcerated, or living in shelters. They help these individuals become self-sufficient and assume leadership roles within the community.The South End Technology Center facilitates the use of technology in ways that encourage individuals to become innovators and producers, tell their own stories, and learn ways of creating just, and humane communities. The Technology Center helps residents who are at an increased risk of joblessness.The City of Boston is committed to digital access and skill-building for all residents. In fiscal year 2019, the City increased the grantmaking power of the Digital Equity Fund from $35,000 to $100,000. Grant recipients have a common goal: to support Bostonians in developing new digital skills and the ability to navigate online resources. Newly funded programs include creative engagement in technology and engineering, courses that teach low-income, Latino immigrant seniors about the use of the internet and computers, and digital literacy classes with a focus on how to protect yourself and others online.\\xa0\"It is never too late to learn the ins and outs of technology and help individuals open their eyes to a new tool,\" Marisol Amaya-Aluigi, Executive Director of La Alianza Hispana said. \"We are honored to receive this grant and so excited to use this money to help constituents in the Boston community.\"The Digital Equity Fund is over seen by the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) and the Digital Equity Fund Council, an external group that is responsible for reviewing applications and selecting recipients. Fund Council members are appointed by Mayor Walsh and serve three-year terms. To qualify for a grant, nonprofit organizations must be Boston-based and serve Boston residents.The goal of the Digital Equity Fund is to explore ways to build individual and community capacity to use the internet, digital skills, and digital tools to pursue professional, educational, and civic endeavors engage with the internet safely and securely develop needs-responsive, community-driven digital skills building opportunities, and increase broadband adoption among Bostonians who do not subscribe to this service in the home.During the first year of this grant program, 2018, the Castle Square Tenants Organization (CSTO) was awarded a $35,000 grant to create a technology audiovisual college course and internship program in partnership with the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology.Mayor Walsh has been committed to bringing more equity and choice to residents throughout Boston, from launching Boston\\'s first-ever Digital Equity Fund to bringing WiFi hotspots to the Boston Public Library\\'s lending program to Boston\\'s Wicked Free WiFi program to working to protect Net Neutrality rules that ensure a fair and open internet.In addition, in November 2018, Mayor Walsh and Verizon announced a new partnership that will accelerate Boston\\'s plan to be one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation, giving residents more choice. Building on the partnership formed in 2016, Verizon will expand its local wireless network speed and capacity to its local 4G LTE network, expand Fios internet and cable television to all neighborhoods in Boston, and collaborate with Boston on Smart Communities solutions.\\xa0The City of Boston\\'s Broadband and Digital Equity efforts improve access to affordable and reliable high speed internet for households and businesses, expand the availability of high speed internet in public places, and facilitate ease of access to up-to-date digital tools.The Department of Innovation and Technology makes sure the networks, computers and systems that support the City are secure and effective.

According to the results of the City\\'s first annual childcare survey released today,\\xa0Making Childcare Work, 86 percent of the respondents listed \"not affordable\" as a top childcare challenge. Additionally, 45 percent said childcare was either \"too far or too difficult\" to find, and almost a third of parents/guardians who stay home to care for their children said they needed to or wanted to work.\\xa0\"I am thrilled to see the City of Boston recognizing the value of our work as education professionals,\" said Ms. Johany Bobadilla, owner of My First Steps Family Childcare in Roxbury. \"We transform our own homes to provide loving learning environments for Boston\\'s babies and young children and when we have the support of the community around us, we become better caregivers.\"\\xa0The City of Boston has lost more than half of its home-based family childcare businesses since 2010, totaling an estimated 400 closings according to data provided by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education Care. At the same time, the population of children under five has increased steadily. Early educators in Boston are almost exclusively women and majority people of color. Jobs in care work, while essential to our society and economy, are often low-paying with little to no benefits and insufficient opportunity for upward economic mobility.\\xa0The combination of care work being low-wage and the closing of many childcare businesses has likely contributed to the high cost of childcare in the state, one of the highest in the nation.\\xa0\"We are honored to host the launch of Mayor Walsh\\'s Childcare Entrepreneur Fund Pilot, which will support early-childhood education programs like IBA Preschool with critical financing,\" said Dr. Vanessa Calderón-Rosado, CEO of Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA), where the launch event was held. \"Early-childhood education programs are vital to helping children develop essential skills that allow them to interpret their world, expand their language and literacy abilities, and form thoughts and express emotions in new ways.

The Playbook, informed by actions that the City of Boston is already implementing through the\\xa0American Cities Climate Challenge, provides a roadmap for cities throughout the globe to reduce citywide emissions and create healthier, more resilient communities.\\xa0If the 100 largest U.S. cities took on the strategies outlined in the Playbook, their total combined emissions would drop by 28.5 percent, meeting their share of the U.S. national target of reducing emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025, the goal set under the Paris Agreement. This work would result in carbon reductions of 224 million metric tons, the equivalent of taking 47.5 million cars off the road for a year, or shutting down 57 coal fired power plants for one year.\"As a coastal city, Boston is on the frontlines of this global crisis and we understand the urgency to act. It\\'s never been more important for cities to lead on climate and Bloomberg Philanthropies has been and continues to be a critical partner in this work,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This week, Boston released its updated Climate Action Plan, a roadmap to significantly reduce our emissions, especially in our buildings and across our transportation sector. Boston is proud to join with our partners as we continue to take major steps toward our ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, and honoring the commitment we made through the Paris Agreement.\"\"Through the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge, 25 major U.S. cities have taken ambitious action to fight climate change, and they\\'re already seeing strong results,\"\\xa0said Michael R. Bloomberg, C40 Board President, UN Secretary-General\\'s Special Envoy for Climate Action, Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Mayor of New York City 2002-2013.\\xa0\"Now, our Climate Action Playbook will help spread their successes to other cities across the U.S. and the world, drawing on the proven policies and programs that are reducing emissions, strengthening infrastructure, and improving public health. Cities are vital leaders in the global climate fight - and we\\'re giving them the tools to make a difference.\"As a part of the American Cities Climate Challenge, the City of Boston is working with world-class experts from leading organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and C40, to meet its ambitious climate goals, ramping up action specifically in the two highest-emitting sectors in cities: transportation and buildings. The nine cities that presented the playbook -- Austin, TX Boston, MA Honolulu, HI Los Angeles, CA Philadelphia, PA Portland, OR San Antonio, TX Seattle, WA and Washington, DC -- are all among the 25 winners in the Climate Challenge.\\xa0Some of the most effective strategies outlined in the Playbook include: initiatives to set benchmarking and performance policies for building energy use decarbonize buildings improve public transit speed, reliability and user experience expand urban pedestrian and micro mobility access procure renewable energy for municipal demand and promote EV adoption through infrastructure and education.\\xa0Earlier this week, Mayor Walsh released an\\xa0update to Boston\\'s Climate Action Plan,\\xa0accelerating action towards carbon neutrality and putting Boston on track to meet the goals laid out in the Paris Climate Agreement. The updates to the plan will significantly cut carbon emissions from Boston\\'s buildings -- the single greatest source of emissions citywide -- and Boston will take immediate action to require new City-owned buildings to lead by example and be zero net carbon. The plan sets Boston\\'s priorities for the next five years on carbon neutrality, with a goal of making Boston carbon neutral by 2050.Citywide carbon emissions are currently down 21 percent -- a 4 percent decrease from the previous year -- and are on track to meet Boston\\'s carbon target for 2020, a 25 percent greenhouse gas reduction. Local municipal operations in fiscal year 2017 were already 41 percent less than 2005 levels, far exceeding Boston\\'s goal set for 2020.\\xa0Boston continues to be one of the world\\'s leading cities committed to urgently pursuing high-ambition climate action. As a leading city on climate action, Boston is already driving down emissions and preparing for sea level rise, extreme temperatures and storms. At the same time, Boston continues to be ranked the most energy efficient city in the country. The top ranking highlights the success of programs such as Renew Boston Trust, Community Choice Energy, and Boston\\'s long-standing building energy benchmarking program.About the Bloomberg American Cities Climate ChallengeRecognizing that cities account for more than 70 percent of global carbon emissions, the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge was formed with an investment of $70 million to enhance the work already being done by mayors across the U.S. and to support cities in the fight against climate change. The Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge aims to go beyond the theoretical and scale up high-impact urban climate solutions that are already proven to succeed - specifically, from the buildings and transportation sectors. World-class partners for the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge will be led by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Delivery Associates. The Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge is part of Mike Bloomberg\\'s American Cities Initiative, a suite of more than $200 million in investments to strengthen city halls and advance critical policies.About Bloomberg PhilanthropiesBloomberg Philanthropies invests in 510 cities and 129 countries around the world to ensure better, longer lives for the greatest number of people.

The Marathon Markers were completed in August 2019.\\xa0We took our time to mark what took place and what was lost. We’re ready to tell the story.Starting with a bump-out of the sidewalk into Boylston Street, the design affirms immediately, that the circumstances of the Bombing changed Boston and its citizens. This bump-out is paved in an intricate pattern with materials that are “native” to Boston’s architecture and its history. Brick and various shades of granite from all over New England are united with bronze. The paving is intricate and requires a great deal of craftsmanship and work. This is to make the space precious and special.In the center circle of the marker is a space for those that lost their lives, the second circle for those that were injured and finally the space for the rest of us, the witnesses. In this design, bronze is used as the material that connects all of the other materials to each other. A unifier, bronze is a noble material but also utilitarian. It represents, in this case, the steadfastness to our shared ideals.\\xa0There are two marker sites, one at the finish line and one further down Boylston street. The finish line marker site holds one stone and the second site holds two stones, which together represent the three victims of the attack. These stones stand in the center of each marker and twist and meld into each other. These particular stones were gathered from places around Boston that were significant to the victims and their families: Franklin Park, Boston University, and Spectacle Island.\\xa0The markers recycled materials that once were in use elsewhere in the city. Flanking both sites on the street side are a series of four tall cast glass pillars of light, encased in four bronze spires. The sharp, diamond shape made of black granite that cuts through the circles represents the violence of the act. The cast glass of these lights contrasts the other materials of stone, brick and metal and signifies the fragility of life and ideas.', 'Mayor Martin J.

Walsh today released an update to Boston\\'s Climate Action Plan, accelerating action towards carbon neutrality and putting Boston on track to meet the goals laid out in the\\xa0Paris Climate Agreement, which the Trump Administration withdrew from in 2017. Despite federal inaction, Boston continues to lead on addressing climate change. The updates to Boston\\'s Climate Action Plan will significantly cut carbon emissions from Boston\\'s buildings -- the single greatest source of emissions citywide -- and Boston will take immediate action to require new City-owned buildings to lead by example and be zero net carbon. This updated plan sets Boston\\'s priorities for the next five years on carbon neutrality, with a goal of making Boston carbon neutral by 2050.As Mayor Walsh releases an update to Boston\\'s Climate Action Plan, he will also attend the international C40 Mayors Climate Summit tomorrow in Copenhagen, discussing climate solutions with other leading cities committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement.

The panel and Summit events will be live-streamed at\\xa0http://bit.ly/c40summit_livestream.\"Climate change is the defining challenge of our time,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"As a coastal city, Boston is at the frontlines of this global crisis, and we understand the urgency. While national action is at a standstill, cities like Boston are leading with plans, solutions and results. The 2019 update to our Climate Action Plan is our roadmap to carbon neutrality, and together we will ensure all of Boston\\'s residents will benefit from our work to protect against climate change, and create an equitable, resilient city for all.\"Boston\\'s Climate Action Plan update will take immediate action to continue reducing carbon emissions in Boston, supporting the Walsh Administration\\'s work to combat climate change. Boston\\'s buildings account for approximately 70 percent of citywide emissions and represent the greatest opportunity for reductions. With buildings as the main contributor to Boston\\'s emissions, the updated Climate Action Plan accelerates action to decarbonize the city\\'s largest buildings, while working to improve incentives and programs to help small buildings and to strengthen workforce development programs.In Boston, city-owned buildings account for nearly three-quarters of carbon emissions from local municipal operations. With this in mind, Boston has worked to reduce its buildings\\' footprints: emissions from local municipal operations in fiscal year 2017 were already 41 percent less than 2005 levels, far exceeding Boston\\'s goal set for 2020. Boston\\'s continued progress towards its goals can be attributed to such\\xa0programs as Renew Boston Trust, which currently implements energy-saving projects and retrofits in existing City-owned buildings. Projects are already underway at 14 municipal buildings across Boston, including libraries, community centers, and police and fire stations.\\xa0The announcement today also begins a process to develop carbon emissions performance standards to decarbonize large buildings over time. This measure, when implemented, could cut citywide emissions nearly 40 percent by 2050 from business-as-usual projections. Citywide carbon emissions are currently down 21 percent -- a 4 percent decrease from the previous year -- and are on track to meet Boston\\'s carbon target for 2020, a 25 percent greenhouse gas reduction.\\xa0\"With the release of today\\'s Climate Action Plan update, Mayor Walsh is continuing to take bold action to combat climate change and to ensure that Boston continues to grow and thrive in the face of unprecedented challenges,\" said Richard A. Dimino, President & CEO of A Better City. \"I applaud the Mayor\\'s commitment to reduce emissions from municipal buildings and look forward to working collaboratively with the City to develop smart strategies to reduce emissions across the buildings and transportation sectors.\"Additional immediate steps outlined in the plan include the development of new zoning requirements for a zero net carbon new construction in new large projects and guidelines for zero net carbon City-funded affordable housing. The updated plan also includes recommendations to continue advocacy for priority transit programs continues Boston\\'s focus on active transportation infrastructure supports zero-emission vehicle deployments and municipal fleet transition to zero and low-emission vehicles. Finally, the plan includes recommendations to encourage efforts to decarbonize Boston\\'s energy supply, and help communities decarbonize throughout Boston.\\xa0\"At the Boston Society of Architects, we know the impact that a well-designed building can have, not only for the climate but also for the health and well-being of the people who work, live, learn, and play within them. Net-zero buildings are something we know how to do--our members are designing them every day. We\\'re excited to work with the City of Boston on the equitable development of better buildings in Boston,\" said Jean Carroon FAIA, 2019 Boston Society of Architects/AIA president.Under Mayor Walsh\\'s leadership, in 2017 the City strengthened Boston\\'s emissions reduction goal to achieving carbon neutrality in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. The 2019 Climate Action Plan Update sets the stage for Boston\\'s transition to carbon neutrality and is\\xa0available on the City\\'s website. Carbon neutrality means releasing no net carbon emissions on an annual basis. For Boston, this means reducing carbon emissions from Boston\\'s buildings, transportation, waste, and energy supply as much as possible, and supporting activities that remove carbon from the atmosphere to compensate for any remaining emissions.\"The strategies detailed in the updated Climate Action Plan will be transformative for building a sustainable and resilient city,\" said City Councilor Matt O\\'Malley and Chairman of the Council\\'s Environment, Sustainability and Parks Committee. \"I am proud to have led the Council\\'s efforts and advocated for a pathway to a carbon-neutral future. It is evident that the greatest contributor to carbon emissions is our buildings. I look forward to working with Mayor Walsh and his administration to promote the construction of zero net carbon buildings in Boston and continue to work to reduce the impacts of climate change.\"\"This new roadmap reflects a steadfast commitment to slashing fossil fuels and making Boston a leader on bold climate action,\" said\\xa0Christina Angelides, NRDC\\'s Director, American Cities Climate Challenge.\\xa0\"These are the sort of ambitious efforts that the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge winners are helping spearhead across the country. With this plan, Boston is truly tackling climate change in its own backyard and setting a strong example for others to follow.\"Boston continues to be one of the world\\'s leading cities committed to urgently pursuing high-ambition climate action. As a leading city on climate action, Boston is already driving down emissions and preparing for sea level rise, extreme temperatures and storms. At the same time, Boston continues to be ranked the most energy efficient city in the country. The top ranking highlights the success of programs such as Renew Boston Trust, Community Choice Energy, and Boston\\'s long-standing building energy benchmarking program.By reducing carbon emissions, Boston can ensure that it\\'s not worsening the impacts of climate change. To prepare for those impacts, Mayor Walsh created a climate-ready vision to enhance Boston\\'s waterfront. Announced during Mayor Walsh\\'s 2018 Chamber of Commerce speech,\\xa0Resilient Boston Harbor\\xa0shows how a network of accessible open spaces and climate-ready buildings and infrastructure will increase resilience to major flooding events, while also increasing access and open space area along the waterfront. Like all the City\\'s current planning, it prepares the City for 40 inches of sea-level rise. Furthering the Mayor\\'s vision are a series of detailed neighborhood plans for coastal resilience. Coastal resilience plans are complete for parts of East Boston and Charlestown, for South Boston, and are underway for Downtown, the North End, and Dorchester.In addition, earlier this year, Mayor Walsh released the\\xa0Zero Waste Boston plan, which would divert at least 80 percent of the City\\'s waste from landfills and municipal solid waste combustors by 2035. The City has begun implementing strategies, including expanding education and outreach campaigns around recycling in partnership with institutions like the New England Aquarium, and is currently developing curbside composting and textile recycling programs for residents.In his fiscal year 2020 budget, Mayor Walsh nearly tripled the City\\'s investment in Greenovate Boston to expand outreach to Boston residents and support community-level climate action. Since the investment, Greenovate launched a climate action guide for Boston residents to reduce their carbon footprint at home, at work, in school and around town, and starting this month will host a series of trainings and dialogues throughout the community on climate change.\"As the voice of students across the Boston Public Schools, we have been calling for more ambitious action on climate change. It\\'s great to see a plan that takes our call for action seriously with real, actionable strategies to reduce carbon emissions in our city,\" said Simon Chernow, Boston Public Schools student and Boston Student Advisory Council member. The Student Advisory Council was active in the Climate Action Plan working group.###', 'BOSTON - Tuesday, October 8, 2019 - In his annual speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Martin J. Walsh today laid out his Administration\\'s progress over the last five years in key areas including housing, transportation and education, and issued a call to action to the business community to take what opportunities Boston\\'s progress has brought, and leverage the City\\'s economic success into lasting, positive change for all. With Mayor Walsh\\'s leadership, Boston is a city that is leading the way on building affordable housing, investing in tools and training for its workforce, prioritizing climate resilience in planning and development, and leading with values of inclusion and equity.\\xa0As the Walsh Administration has invested in its residents, Boston\\'s economy has grown, adding 120,000 new jobs, with an unemployment rate under three percent, and new investments being made in Boston\\'s housing stock, schools, parks, and libraries. With this year-over-year growth in mind, Mayor Walsh today challenged Boston\\'s business community to step up as good corporate partners in helping address some of the toughest challenges the city faces, including the need for more affordable housing, safe and reliable public transportation, and high-quality education for all students.\"Boston is as strong as it\\'s ever been, but if we\\'re going to continue to thrive and meet our greatest challenges, then we\\'ve got more work to do. Today I come before you with an appeal to every industry, organization, and individual in a position of leadership in our city: to focus our energies, strengthen our partnerships, and combine our voices to meet our biggest shared challenges,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"To keep our economy working, we must provide what working people need: in housing, in transit, at schools, and in jobs. We have to give every single person a place to live and a path toward their dreams. To do that, we need to be focused not just on the short term and the bottom line, but on the long term and greater good to build a strong middle class, an economy built to last, and a Boston that continues to lead in the 21st century.\"\\xa0In his speech, Mayor Walsh celebrated major transformations being made for the first time in a generation, including investing in the Boston Common and Franklin Park building new schools focused specifically on STEM and arts education building Boston\\'s first new firehouse in 30 years spearheading a redesign of City Hall Plaza and earning perfect AAA bond ratings for six consecutive years, the first time that\\'s been achieved in the city\\'s history. Boston\\'s work on racial equity and resilience has also brought attention to the city, and for the first time in nearly 40 years, the City of Boston will host the NAACP National Convention, welcoming members throughout the United States and the world who are the premier advocates for civil rights in their communities.Mayor Walsh also announced that tomorrow he will travel to Copenhagen for the C40 World Mayors Summit discussing climate solutions with other leading cities committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement. As North American Co-Chair for C40\\'s Steering Committee, Mayor Walsh will participate in a panel to share Boston\\'s global leadership on preparing for rising sea levels and climate change. Earlier this morning, Mayor Walsh released an update to Boston\\'s\\xa0Climate Action Plan, accelerating action towards carbon neutrality and continuing Boston\\'s ambitious goal to be a carbon free city by 2050.In last year\\'s speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Walsh introduced\\xa0\"Resilient Boston Harbor,\"\\xa0a plan that lays out strategies along Boston\\'s 47-mile shoreline that increases access and open space along the waterfront, while better protecting the city during a major flooding event. In just one year, the City opened Martin\\'s Park along Fort Point Channel, started construction on the Langone-Puopolo Park in the North End, and moved forward with the redesign of Moakley Park in South Boston. Along with these upgrades to protect Boston\\'s shoreline, in July of this year, the Administration proposed the city\\'s first capital plan that dedicates 10 percent of all spending to resilience projects.\\xa0\\xa0\"We can\\'t take the opportunity before us for granted, because as far as we\\'ve come, big challenges of success, like housing demand and transit capacity, remain,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"These challenges, some national problems like inequality and the hollowing out of middle class, are threats to our economy. We have the opportunity now to address them by building on our success.\"\\xa0In his speech, Mayor Walsh focused on three cornerstones he called upon the business community to lead on: housing, transportation and education.\\xa0Creating more middle-income housing, stopping displacements, and ensuring every sector is playing their partSince Mayor Walsh took office in 2014, the City of Boston has created over 31,000 new homes and has an additional 27,000 units in the pipeline, ahead of pace to meet its goal of 69,000 new homes by 2030. Twenty percent of those new homes are income-restricted units. Boston is currently are number one in the United States for income-restricted, affordable housing.\\xa0Boston has also:Turned three million square feet of city land into nearly 500 first-time homeownership opportunities and over 1,100 rental unitsIncreased Inclusionary Development and Linkage collectionsModernized community planning and opened up new areas for transit-oriented developmentDedicated nearly $4 million of Community Preservation funding to a new, low-interest mortgage program for first-time home buyers.\\xa0Boston\\'s strategy is working. Rents have stabilized in some neighborhoods and we\\'re on the way to creating 1,000 new homeowners. However, Boston needs the business community to ensure progress continues, and affordable housing does not remain out of reach for residents.Mayor Walsh has called upon the business community to:\\xa0Support Governor Baker\\'s Housing Choice bill. It changes local approval from a two-thirds vote to a simple, democratic majority. It\\'s a simple fix, with positive results for Boston\\'s workforceEncourage developers to build middle class housingClamp down on displacement, and take a stand against pushing residents out of their homes and communities.\\xa0\"The bottom line is, housing is not a commodity it\\'s a community,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"It\\'s where people build their lives. We have to be able to provide security and stability in our communities, and we have to be able to house our workforce. We also need owners and investors to take a step back and consider the human impacts of their actions. Profits can\\'t come at this kind of cost. It\\'s not a price and it\\'s not a practice that we\\'re going to accept in the City of Boston.\"Advocating for a 21st century regional transportation plan to meet today\\'s needs and support tomorrow\\'s growthIn addressing one of the most pressing challenges facing Boston and other municipalities, Mayor Walsh reaffirmed his commitment to fighting for a reliable, frequent and affordable public transportation system that meets today\\'s needs and supports tomorrow\\'s growth.\\xa0Together with input from residents across the city, the City has:Built Boston\\'s first bus lanes in a generation, in Roslindale, Allston, and now the North End and Charlestown. Tens of thousands of people have had their commutes improved by these lanes, and we\\'re working on more\\xa0Invested in a new Transit Team that is working with the MBTA right now on improvements in Mattapan, South Boston, and RoxburyInvested $6.5 million in T passes for our youthCalled on the T to protect seniors from fare increases, and provide late-night bus service for third-shift workers, and they are doing those things\\xa0Testified at the MBTA\\'s Fiscal and Management Control Boardfor our plan to increase Fairmount Line service and Commuter Rail frequency across Greater Boston.\\xa0Under Mayor Walsh\\'s leadership, the City has also put together its long-term transportation plan,\\xa0Go Boston 2030, which focused on improving access, equity and reliability in transportation for all of Boston\\'s residents.\\xa0\"Recently, I sat with a group of business leaders--you understand the urgency,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"We need your voices to communicate what\\'s at stake for your workers, your businesses, and our economy. And we need your expertise to help develop solutions. Just as we\\'ve done in the City of Boston, we need to work together, as partners, on a comprehensive plan to address the statewide need for better transportation. And we need to make the hard decisions necessary to fund and implement that plan.\"Providing support and innovation to our students so every school can make progress and achievement gaps can be closed\\xa0Mayor Walsh believes that a good, strong education is the best investment we can make in Boston\\'s children and their collective future, and is proud that more Boston students than ever before are in high-quality schools. It\\'s also why he has enacted the highest budget for Boston Public Schools every year since taking office, investing in the proven strategies for closing achievement and opportunity gaps. The City of Boston is committed to looking at the whole student and removing barriers to learning wherever we can find them, which means investing in programs like new kitchens to provide healthy food, providing MBTA passes to all Boston students grades 7-12, and offering free hygiene products for girls. In addition, the City has added nurses to every school, and has made available mental health professionals for students, and has support available for students experiencing homelessness.\\xa0Boston has made historic investments in its students and schools over the last five years, including:\\xa0Funded a longer school dayCommitted to having a pre-kindergarten seat for every four-year-old in BostonGiving every five-year-old a college savings account\\xa0Expanded Summer Learning programs to 14,000 students\\xa0Created a facilities program from scratch to replace roofs, windows, boilers, and furniture and provide the technology that many students don\\'t have access to at home. Through Boston\\'s investments, we\\'re building new high schools designed for 21st-century education.However, Boston\\'s efforts don\\'t end with students graduating. Mayor Walsh\\'s focus on ensuring students have every opportunity, from cradle to career, means he has called on businesses to join in partnership with the City, to ensure economic prosperity is felt by its students. In his speech, Mayor Walsh challenged companies to hire most residents, looking to companies like Natixis, Vertex and Autodesk that partner with students to improve their chances for success.\\xa0Mayor Walsh thanked the Speaker, Senate President, education committee chairs and the Boston delegation for the Student Opportunity Act, which has the key principles to meet the needs facing every district and every student.\\xa0\"We have to show people from every neighborhood and walk of life that this great city we\\'ve built together wasn\\'t built for someone else, it was built for them and everyone,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I\\'m asking Boston\\'s employers to draw from the deep well of talent in our neighborhoods. I\\'m asking you to hire more Bostonians. Our residents are skilled, they are resilient, they are diverse, and they have a lived understanding of culture and community in today\\'s America. You need people like them in your workplace, and you don\\'t have to look far to find them.\"Please find Mayor Walsh remarks to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce as prepared for delivery\\xa0here.###', 'Thank you Miceal [Chamberlain], thank you Jim [Rooney], thank you everyone for coming here this morning. Thank you to the members of the City Council who are here.Before I get into the heart of my remarks today, I want to take a minute to update you on the plan I introduced at the Chamber last year: Resilient Boston Harbor. That plan invests in open spaces on our waterfront, creating better parks and protecting our neighborhoods from flooding. The progress we’ve made in just one year is incredible.\\xa0Our shoreline is getting stronger, and it’s just the start. In July, we passed Boston’s first capital plan that dedicates 10% of all spending to resilience projects. We’re going to do that every year, as an investment in our people, our communities, and our businesses.\\xa0We are acting locally and leading globally. Tomorrow I head to Copenhagen, Denmark, for the C40 climate summit. C40 is a network of the world’s largest cities, working together to slow climate change. I serve as North American Co-Chair, with Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles. I’ll bring with me a brand-new update to our Climate Action Plan, which many of you in this room helped us put together. It lays out the steps Boston will take to be carbon free by 2050. This goal is necessary and attainable. Our work so far has reduced Boston’s total emissions by 21%. And our leadership has been recognized. This summer we were named the #1 most energy efficient city in the U.S. for the fourth time in a row. It’s a credit to both the policies we put in place and the investments that building owners are making in Boston’s future.\\xa0We are leading on issues of local, state, national, and global significance—and our efforts are transforming Boston.\\xa0We moved Boston into a new era. We opened up city government and welcomed new voices to the table, we set ambitious goals and built new systems and strategies to meet them, and we led with our values of inclusion, equity, and compassion.\\xa0Our policy innovations are being taken up by cities and states across the country—in Women’s Advancement, Immigrant Advancement, Workforce Development, senior supports, disability, veterans services, Racial Equity, Recovery Services, and housing the homeless.\\xa0We do this work in partnership with residents, with nonprofits, and with the business community. And as a result, our economy is thriving. Unemployment is below 3%, our established industries are growing, and recently we were named the fifth best city in the world for technology startups.\\xa0Together we’ve made Boston the safest, the healthiest, the busiest, the most employed and the most productive it’s ever been, and the benefits of this progress have been felt in every neighborhood of our city.\\xa0But the question I have today is, what will we do with this opportunity? It’s not an opportunity that was given to us it’s one we earned. But we can’t take it for granted, because as far as we’ve come, big challenges remain. Some are the challenges of success, like housing demand and transit capacity. Some are national problems, like inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class. All of them are threats to our economy and to each of the organizations and businesses represented in this room. We have the opportunity now, by building on our success, to address them.So today I’m going to talk about housing, transportation, and education. I could start with data. But I spend most of my time out in the neighborhoods of Boston, and here’s what people are saying to me.\\xa0I talked to a 30-year-old city employee who’s 8 years into a good career, just got married, and is thinking about a family. But he looks at the housing market and he’s losing hope of ever being able to afford a home.\\xa0I met a mother in Mattapan who spends 2 hours of her life, every day, taking multiple buses to get to and from a job in the Longwood Medical Area. She’s working hard for her family, but she’s forced to rely on a transit system that isn’t working for her.\\xa0I talk to parents who say their family’s future depends on which high school their child gets access to. And I hear from young adults who grew up in our city, overcame obstacles, did everything we asked of them—but can’t get a foot in the door at a Boston company.\\xa0These aren’t marginal examples. They are people at the heart and soul of our economy and our community. They are from all races, in every neighborhood. They’re working in City Hall and in all of your offices. They are our middle class and those fighting to be in our middle class.\\xa0Meeting their challenges is my agenda—and it must be our agenda—because a city that can’t house its workforce is a city where employers lose talent a state that can’t move its workforce is a state with an expiration date on its economic leadership and a country losing its middle class is a country that’s losing its soul.\\xa0So today, I want to do something different. Today I come before you with an appeal. It’s an appeal to every industry, organization, and individual in a position of leadership in our city: to focus our energies, strengthen our partnerships, and combine our voices to meet these shared challenges.\\xa0It’s a call to action: to show our young workers, our long-time residents and our newest Bostonians—people from every neighborhood and walk of life—that this great city we’ve built wasn’t built for someone else, it was built for them and for everyone.\\xa0That’s what our values demand of us, and it’s what our future depends on. It will define the kind of government we get, it will define the fate of every business and nonprofit in our city, and it will define our ability to compete on the global stage. The action we take now on housing and transit and schools will define Boston for the next 10 years and the next generation.\\xa0Let’s start with housing. When I took office, Boston faced a housing crisis. So we brought the stakeholders to the table and we created a plan to address it.\\xa0The net result is we have created over 31,000 new homes in our city, we have an additional 27,000 units in the pipeline, and we are ahead of pace to meet our goal of 69,000 new homes by 2030. 20% of those new homes are subsidized units. We are Number One in the United States for income-restricted, affordable housing. Let me repeat that. We are the Number One city in the United States for income-restricted, affordable housing.Our strategy is working. Rents have stabilized in some neighborhoods and we’re on the way to creating 1,000 new homeowners.But there’s much more work to be done. I talked about the situation facing young professionals in City Hall. I hear the same stories from talented young people in every business I visit. “I’m 30 and still have roommates.” “My rent is so high that I can’t save for a down payment.” “I want to stay in Boston, but I can’t afford to live here.”\\xa0These are people with good paying jobs. The situation facing the working class and senior citizens, if they can’t get subsidized housing, is even tougher. Market rents and home prices are simply beyond their reach, and people are being forced out of our city. It’s not fair, it’s not sustainable, and it’s not good for our economy.\\xa0So here’s what we need to do. We need to create more middle-income housing. We need to stop the displacements. And we need everyone to play their part.\\xa0This isn’t just a Boston problem. We have a regional housing shortage, decades in the making. So we need more production across our region.\\xa0Working with the Metro Mayors Coalition, we developed a regional plan. Now, cities and towns need to set their own housing goals and work to meet them, the way Boston has done. But fellow mayors and town managers tell me about good housing proposals with majority support, that are being constantly blocked. So I’m asking for your support today, for the Governor’s Housing Choice bill. It changes local approval from a two-thirds vote to a simple, democratic majority. It’s a simple fix, with positive results for your workforce. It needs all of our support.\\xa0Second, we need developers to build middle-income housing.\\xa0We’ve built luxury apartments, condos, and townhouses. That fills a need and it takes pressure off our older housing stock. We’re also building and preserving record amounts of low-income housing. We’ll continue to protect our most vulnerable families and seniors.\\xa0But what’s missing is the middle. And the people who fall through that gap are the people in our offices and our stores and our restaurants, whose hard work makes our economy tick.\\xa0I understand that investors want to maximize their profits. But there has to be a balance between profit and impact. Our communities need middle-class housing. Our workforce needs middle-class housing. And we stand ready to partner with anyone who will step forward to help address this need.\\xa0Lastly, pushing people out of their homes and their communities has to stop. This summer my office got a call from a 77-year-old man. After living in the same home in the Fenway for over 40 years, he got an eviction notice, no cause given. He’s not alone. We’re getting these calls all the time: from seniors with nowhere else to turn from single mothers, facing rent increases so aggressive, it might as well be an eviction notice.\\xa0We created an Office of Housing Stability to tackle this crisis. It’s working with people to help them stay in their homes, sometimes the only homes they’ve ever known.\\xa0But we need stronger tools. We need the legislature to pass our bills protecting seniors and guaranteeing right-to-counsel for tenants facing eviction.\\xa0We also need owners and investors to take a step back and consider the human impacts of their actions. Profits can’t come at this kind of cost. It’s not a price and it’s not a practice that we’re going to accept in the City of Boston.\\xa0The bottom line is, housing is not a commodity it’s a community. It’s where people build their lives. We have to be able to provide security and stability in our communities, and we have to be able to house our workforce.\\xa0That’s why employers have an essential role to play in developing solutions, and why we’re going to continue this conversation with the business community. I’m going to work with Jim Rooney to bring members of the Chamber together with my housing team. We are going to identify opportunities to create workforce housing, and I invite everyone to bring your input, your ideas, and your resources to the table.\\xa0Transportation is a critical part of the solution.\\xa0A reliable, frequent, and affordable regional rail system would expand housing and job options for commuters. It would reduce traffic congestion. It would cut carbon emissions. It would unlock new levels of productivity in our economy.\\xa0As you know, Boston does not control the MBTA. It’s a state-managed system. But we are the largest payer into that system. And we’ve done more than ever before to improve public transit in our city. We’ve done it by listening to our residents’ needs and listening to new ideas, by developing a comprehensive plan, and by making hard decisions to raise the revenue to implement it.\\xa0We’re going to keep building these collaborations. But there’s a bigger picture we have to address. Our residents, workers, and customers, don’t just move inside Boston’s borders. Transportation is a regional and statewide system. So the challenge can only be met with a regional, statewide plan, that puts public transit at the center.\\xa0In Boston we see it, and we experience it, every day.\\xa0 Our worst congestion is at the points where people are trying to get on and off the highways that connect our city to the region. Many of those drivers want and would use better transit options.\\xa0Our workforce is speaking loud and clear. A survey by the Mass. Biotech Council found that 60% of life science workers would change jobs tomorrow if they could get a better commute. That figure more than doubled in three years.\\xa0We appreciate the $8 billion investment over 5 years that the state is making in the T. Getting closer to a “state of good repair” is necessary. But it’s not enough. A state of good repair means bringing the Red Line I rode yesterday morning back to the quality of the system I rode to school as a teenager in the 1980s. Our population has grown by 100,000 people since then! We need a plan for the 21st century, to meet today’s needs and support tomorrow’s growth.\\xa0Recently, I sat with a group of business leaders. They told me how some of their employees have given up on public transit how they can no longer start meetings before 10 a.m. and how they had to add staff to make up for transit delays.\\xa0You understand the urgency. We need your voices to communicate what’s at stake for your workers, your businesses, and our economy. And we need your expertise to help develop solutions.\\xa0Just as we’ve done in the City of Boston, we need to work together, as partners, on a comprehensive plan to address the statewide need for better transportation. And we need to make the hard decisions necessary to fund and implement that plan.\\xa0The final challenge I want to address today is education.\\xa0Our goal is to give every child in Boston access to high-quality schools, from pre-kindergarten through high school and beyond.\\xa0That’s why we’ve made historic investments in our schools, growing the BPS budget to nearly $1.2 billion. And we carefully targeted those investments to proven strategies for closing achievement gaps.\\xa0We’re also looking at the “whole student” and knocking down barriers to learning wherever we find them. That means installing dozens of new kitchens to provide healthy food that many children aren’t getting at home. It’s why we’re giving free T passes to students in 7th through 12th grade and free hygiene products for girls. And it’s why we’re adding nurses at every school, mental health professionals to respond to trauma, and housing supports for students experiencing homelessness.All of these investments, with the hard work of our teachers, school leaders, and students, are paying off. By almost any objective measure, the Boston Public Schools continue to improve. Today, more Boston students than ever before are in high-quality schools. On the most recent MCAS results, two thirds of BPS schools showed improvement. The state determined that our district as a whole is making “substantial progress.”\\xa0We still have a long way to go. We need every school to be making progress, because we can never be satisfied as long as achievement gaps remain.\\xa0But I want everyone in this conversation to understand two very important things about our schools.\\xa0First, we are graduating an incredible number of bright, talented, diverse, ambitious young people. We are proud of our students.\\xa0Second, there is much more potential in our schools waiting to be unlocked—but profound challenges stand in the way.\\xa0Our students need and deserve unique levels of support and innovation. That’s what we’re working to provide.\\xa0And that’s why we fought so hard for a state education funding bill that would recognize these realities. I want to thank the Speaker, Senate President, education committee chairs, and the Boston delegation for their work on this legislation. It has the key principles we fought for, to meet the needs facing every district and every student. It’s important this legislation passes and its commitments get fully funded.\\xa0But it doesn’t end there. Our new Superintendent, Brenda Cassellius, hit the ground running. She’s visiting every single school in the district. She’s working with the School Committee on plans to reform the central office, upgrade curriculum, and better support students in the classroom.\\xa0What our kids ultimately need is what students in many other districts take for granted: a stable network of supports and opportunities surrounding them at home, at school, all year round. Too many of our students don’t have that.\\xa0But you can help provide it. We’ve seen the difference the business community can make.\\xa0Natixis helped the Winthrop Elementary in Dorchester rise from the bottom to the top of the state accountability system.\\xa0Vertex built a learning lab that serves students from 15 BPS schools, and provides teachers with high-quality STEM curriculum.\\xa0The Venture Café Foundation provides student workshops in technology, design, and entrepreneurship in Roxbury.\\xa0And Autodesk provides unique professional development experiences for teachers at 13 innovative companies in our city.\\xa0When a company makes a commitment to our schools, good things happen. Our students are lifted up. Your team grows its sense of purpose. Our city gets more connected and our future gets stronger.\\xa0So I’m asking everyone in the business community to become a more active partner in our schools. You can build that community of support our young people need. You can help close achievement gaps. You can strengthen and guide our future workforce.That brings me to my final request. I’m asking Boston’s employers to draw from the deep well of talent in our neighborhoods. I’m asking you to hire more Bostonians.Our residents are skilled, they are resilient, they are diverse, and they have a lived understanding of culture and community in today’s America. You need people like them in your workplace, and you don’t have to look far to find them. Let me share a couple of examples.\\xa0Kaia Walters is a 1st-generation American who went to Boston Public Schools and studied at UMass Boston. She has a passion for community and a knack for building websites.\\xa0Raymond Ortega grew up in South Boston and graduated from Charlestown High. He recently wrapped up five years in the United States Marine Corps, where he worked on airplane technology.\\xa0Kaia and Raymond graduated this year from the Resilient Coders boot camp. It’s a program we partner with that helps diverse young people elevate their skills, and works with local companies to hire them. Now they’re professional software engineers, making their companies and our city stronger, and they are here with us this morning.My message today is clear. We’ve worked together to create an environment in our city where business can thrive and communities can thrive. Boston is as strong as it’s ever been. But if we’re going to continue to thrive—if we’re going to meet our greatest challenges—and build an even stronger future—then we’ve got more work to do.\\xa0To keep our economy working, we must provide what working people need: in housing, in transit, at schools, and in jobs. We have to give every single person a place to live and a path toward their dreams. To do that, we need to be focused not just on the short term and the bottom line, but on the long term and greater good.\\xa0Recently the CEOs of nearly 200 of America’s biggest companies published a statement re-defining the purpose of a corporation to include “supporting the communities in which we work.”\\xa0I’m confident that’s how we do business in Boston. It’s a big reason for our success. But it’s time to redouble our efforts. And this is my call to action. I need your partnership now, more than ever—to confront our challenges in housing, transportation, and education—so that we can build a strong middle class, an economy built to last, and a Boston that continues to lead in the 21st century.\\xa0Thank you. God Bless you. And I look forward to continuing this conversation. ', 'BOSTON - Monday, October 7, 2019 - In his\\xa0testimony\\xa0before the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh today spoke in support of a service enhancement plan for the Fairmount Line and advocated for improved regional rail service across Greater Boston. Fairmount Line improvements are identified as priorities in both the Go Boston 2030 transportation plan, as well as the Imagine Boston 2030 citywide plan.\"The City of Boston\\'s partnership with the MBTA is one of the most important we have,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Our residents depend on it our workforce depends on it our economy and our environment depend on it. I will always advocate for the best possible service, to meet the needs of our residents today and tomorrow. We need to take the essential next steps to improve mobility in our city and region, and increasing services levels on the Fairmount Line will be an asset for our residents, city and state.\"The Fairmount Line provides public transit service to parts of Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and Hyde Park neighborhoods of Boston that have limited access to subway service. The City\\'s plan calls for eight additional trips each weekday - tailored to better support early morning and late night shift workers as well as students who live and learn along the corridor - as a short term measure, as well as a focus on additional longer term investments to improve frequency. The City is also working with the MBTA to to integrate the Fairmount Line into the subway and bus payment system, allowing passengers boarding at several stations to use their Charlie Cards.\"One-fifth of Boston\\'s population lives along the nine-mile route of the Fairmount Line, and the residents in this corridor are some of the most transit dependent residents in the city and have some of the longest average commutes improving the frequency of the Fairmount Line increases equity and expands opportunity in Boston,\" said Chief of Streets Chris Osgood. \"The City also strongly encourages enhancing service for the entire regional rail system. Strengthening the region\\'s regional rail system would shift a larger percentage of Boston\\'s workforce to public transit, decreasing congestion, lowering emissions and improving public health.\"The City of Boston is investing heavily around commuter rail stations in neighborhoods along the Fairmount Line. An economic plan is underway at Newmarket Square an arts and innovation district is being created at Uphams Corner $11 million is being invested to improve Columbia Road adjacent to the Four Corners station a multi-million dollar renovation of Harambee Park is in the works and major roadways around the Blue Hill Avenue stop are being redesigned. Investments in public transit complement these advancements.Advocating for a stronger regional rail system to be established over time, the City expects that this system would address congestion from private vehicles entering and exiting the city limits.\\xa0 Additionally, it would lower emissions, meet climate goals, and improve public health, particularly if the rail system were electrified.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To accelerate improvements in public transit, the City of Boston has invested in a dedicated Transit Team within the Boston Transportation Department that is working with the MBTA to improve service, and create innovative solutions.\\xa0 Progress has been made and efforts to further enhance public transit service will continue. Recent collaboration between the City of Boston and the MBTA has resulted in several achievements including:Bus priority lanes that welcome bicyclists have been built on Washington Street in Roslindale, Brighton Avenue in Allston, and North Washington Street, offering quicker commutes for the thousands of people who ride on them each day.MBTA passes have been made available to 7th\\xa0through 12th\\xa0grade students in all Boston schools.Seniors have been protected from the MBTA fare increase.Late night bus service has been provided to support third shift workers.###', 'Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) received a complete application to demolish the residence\\xa0at 3-5\\xa0S Whitney Street\\xa0in Roxbury, 02120.We will post each Demo Delay\\xa0application to provide the public with information about proposed demolitions as early as possible in the\\xa0Article 85 process.

My hair grows out this way. Proudly kinky. Proudly nappy. That’s my hair, and it has been a journey to actually say that out loud and be proud of that,” said Councilor Edwards to her colleagues during this week’s Council meeting.On Wednesday, the Council voted to adopt a resolution supporting Massachusetts bill HD4497, a resolution relative to preventing discrimination against natural hairstyles.Hairstyles such as braids, locs, twists,\\xa0 and other styles serve both practical needs and as cultural manifestations of black and African-descendant communities. Discrimination against natural hairstyles negatively impacts people of color, particularly women and girls, in school, in the workplace, in businesses where they are seeking services and in places of socialization.States such as California and New York have banned discrimination against natural hairstyles. In 2017, the Attorney General of Massachusetts took action against the Mystic Valley Regional Charter School for policies regarding hairstyle and dress code that appeared to offer differential treatment toward students of color, particularly black girls.Councilor Edwards explained the importance of HD4497 in light of the amount of overregulation of natural hair that occurs in school dress and hair codes. These policies disproportionately impact black girls, and as a result prevents them from going to school and has increased the amount of times they have been expelled.Councilor Edwards talked about research that has shown that the majority of the reasons why black girls are disciplined in school is because of dress code violations and hair code violations. She said, “It was shocking to me because my hair is natural. The way the regulations are written for the Mystic Valley Regional Charter School would have prevented me as a young girl from going to school there. I had to come forward, not only to support this legislation, but to give you a face to who this law would be impacting. A younger version of me.”', 'There are two separate opportunities — one for an interior artwork and one for an exterior artwork. This international call is open to all artists.

If an artist in interested in being considered for both opportunities, they must submit a separate application for each.\\xa0These projects are funded by the City’s Percent for Art program, which allocates one percent of the City’s capital borrowing for the commission of public art. Over the next five years, $13.4 million has been allocated to this program. This, combined with $80,000 for temporary public art projects in the next year and several new City staff positions, is the most funding the City has ever dedicated to public art.This is an exciting project, because BAA is Boston’s only public high school for the visual and performing arts. The school serves a diverse student body, the majority of which comes from low-income families, and its mission is to prepare a community of aspiring artist-scholars-citizens to be successful in their professional careers and to be engaged members of their communities.BAA is currently undergoing a $125 million reconstruction, which will result in a state-of-the-art facility that features dedicated rehearsal and performance spaces, gallery space, studios for music, visual arts, and fashion design, academic classrooms, recreation areas, kitchens, and student commons.The BAA uses four shared values as guiding principles for the teaching and learning environment, which artists/teams might consider when crafting their proposals:The commissioned artist(s) or team(s) must also include a robust educational component in their process.

Walsh today released a\\xa0strategic plan\\xa0aimed at addressing the urgent public health crisis in Newmarket Square and surrounding areas, where a high number of individuals who have substance use disorder seek health care and shelter. The plan represents a short-term, action-oriented strategy that will guide the City\\'s work on public health, public safety and quality of life issues that impact individuals who are struggling, and their surrounding communities. The plan includes hiring new staff members designated to work in the area, funding for new programs and initiatives, improved coordination between existing services, and a renewed focus on the services and efforts being employed by city officials to address this national crisis.The strategy is captured in the Melnea Cass/Mass Ave. 2.0 plan, which presents key goals and measurable activities, as well as goals related to coordination and alignment of services. The activities laid out in this plan will be evaluated at six-month intervals to determine the City\\'s progress towards its goals.\\xa0\"What we have on our hands is an opioid epidemic of historic proportions that is taking hold of too many lives, and tearing apart families in every city and town in our nation,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"As a society, we will never turn our backs on people who are at the most vulnerable time in their life. Through this plan, we are focusing on the area of Melnea Cass/Mass Ave to make the needed improvements for those who are struggling: those with a substance use disorder, and the residents impacted by this epidemic throughout Boston\\'s neighborhoods. There is not one perfect solution to dealing with this crisis, but we are committed to doing everything we can. Our primary focus will always be on the safety and wellbeing of all people in the City of Boston, and I\\'m asking for us all to work together hand in hand as a community to confront this national crisis.\"The plan focuses on four priority areas that have been identified through public outreach:\\xa01. Connecting those struggling with substance use disorder (SUD) with resources and a pathway to recovery, including:\\xa02. Ensuring public safety for all residents by reducing criminal activity, including:\\xa0\\xa03. Focusing on quality of life issues for our residents and businesses, including:\"The Melnea Cass / Mass Ave. 2.0 Plan is a very encouraging step in addressing one of the most complicated issues our city faces,\" said State Representative Jon Santiago. \"By providing a comprehensive approach to the public health and quality of life concerns impacting our neighborhoods, we have an opportunity to not only save more lives, but shed stigma and improve conditions for all those residing in the area.

The investment will increase the ability of street outreach workers to connect people with treatment services in Newmarket Square and surrounding neighborhoods, and expand the capacity of the Mobile Sharps Team to collect improperly discarded syringes throughout the City.Mayor Walsh created the Boston\\'s Street Outreach Team in 2016 to connect people in Newmarket Square experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder with services and overdose prevention supplies (including naloxone). The teams canvas the neighborhood to offer guidance to people in need of recovery and homeless services, and to direct residents to shelter and programs like the Engagement Center. Last year alone, the Street Outreach and Engagement Center teams completed almost 2,000 client referrals to programs and shelters.Last year, Mayor Walsh provided additional funding for four new outreach positions, doubling the capacity of the team to eight outreach workers. With the State\\'s investments, the team will now consist of 16 outreach workers, as well as a centralized system for rapid response to address issues in the neighborhood.The Mobile Sharps Team, most recently expanded through the City\\'s FY20 budget with new staff, new technology and additional pickup improvements, is a team of currently two team members that pick up improperly discarded syringes throughout the City. With the State\\'s investment, the Mobile Sharps Team will now have four additional members, further expanding its capacity to six team members. Since its creation in 2015, residents are able to report a loose syringe through the Boston 311 app or phone hotline, dispatching a cleanup crew to the area to properly dispose of the needle.\\xa0In the first eight months of 2019, the team received over 62,000 pickup requests through Boston 311. In addition to the Mobile Sharps Team, trainings on the safe collection and disposal of syringes are regularly provided to the Parks Department, Boston Public Schools (BPS) custodians, and the Department of Public Works. There are also 14 needle kiosks throughout the City that allow individuals to safely dispose of used syringes.\\xa0The City has taken a comprehensive approach to tackle the opioid epidemic.\\xa0The City serves people in all stages of the continuum of care, from providing harm reduction services to ensure people can maintain health in various aspects of their lives, to connecting people with beds at treatment programs, to offering outpatient care and long-term peer support.The City of Boston is planning an innovative and holistic recovery campus on Long Island that will expand essential recovery services for the region, fill gaps in the continuum of care and utilize the natural environment to provide a healing space. The City has contracted with Gensler and Ascension Recovery Services to identify the types of services, resources and treatment options that would be best suited for the island and create a master plan for the recovery campus. The draft design for the Long Island bridge was completed\\xa0earlier this year.\\xa0Continuing these efforts, the City of Boston\\xa0filed a complaint\\xa0in Suffolk Superior Court against 13 opioid manufacturers, four distributors, and one local doctor that have contributed to the local opioid epidemic through misleading marketing and reckless dissemination of opioids that has led to the\\xa0deaths of more than 832 Boston residents since 2014.

In addition to library card sign-ups, residents can register for BPL programming for children and adults.Caren Rosales and Theresa Furbish, outreach librarians for BPL, cite City Hall as one of the most successful places to reach residents outside of the library itself.Caren has spoken to families “who just moved to Boston and are looking for some English learning and citizenship resources, some people who are looking for entertainment with the kids out of school, and some who are excited to learn about free adult education classes.”According to Caren, a highlight of the summer was meeting a wedding party of 11 people “of all ages, who came into City Hall looking very dapper.”“Everyone celebrated the new marriage with loud cheers and new library cards.”', \"Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced October is Cyber Security Awareness Month in the City of Boston. This month is dedicated to raising awareness of Cyber Security, and encouraging residents to ensure their own information is secure.\\xa0“Our Department of Innovation and Technology works to utilize technology in the best and smartest ways possible to make residents lives better,” said Mayor Walsh. “This October, we encourage residents to make sure they’re taking precautions to ensure they stay safe online, and protect themselves in October and beyond.”The City has a vital role in identifying, protecting, and responding to cyber threats that may have an impact on individual or collective security and privacy. The Cyber Security Team, part of Boston’s of the Department of Innovation and Technology, has taken extensive measures to maintain security. This year, Mayor Walsh appointed the first Chief Information Security Officer, Greg McCarthy.\\xa0The City’s Cyber Security Team encourages everyone to practice good cyber hygiene this month – and throughout the year – with these tips and tricks to stay safe on digital devices.Security for a mobile device:\\xa0Lock your device. Use the password, passcode, swipe, or PIN function — or set up touch identification — so that only you can get access.Keep all your software up-to-date. The operating system and apps you use put out new releases that guard against the latest malware, viruses and other threats. Make sure you always have the most recent versions.Delete things you don’t use. Delete all the apps and software that you do not need anymore or no longer use.When using public WiFi:\\xa0Remember that public Wi-Fi is never secure and can’t always be trusted. Use public Wi-Fi with caution. Don’t log into anything sensitive (like financial services or email) while using it.Be secure by getting a VPN (virtual private network) login to use when you are out and about. Another secure connection option is using a personal mobile hotspot.Securing a wireless network:\\xa0Change the name of your network from the manufacturer’s default to something personal to you. Also, reset the password from the pre-set one to something complex. Remember to use a long and strong password.Look at your network’s security settings and switch to WPA2, if that’s an option. If not, use WPA. Both of these are more secure than WEP. Also, if there is an option for “Remote Management” turn that one off.If you can, set up a guest login for your network. Then if someone is visiting your home, you can share only the guest password with them, not your password.Make sure you check periodically for any updates to your router’s software, so you have the latest version. You should also consider setting up a firewall.Anti-virus:There are free security scans available from well-known companies. Use them to check out your systems. While there is a cost involved, buying anti-virus software is a good way to protect your computer (or mobile device). You can prevent viruses and other types of cyber attacks.Make sure you set up all your security software to automatically update. That way, when a new virus or hack is spotted, you’ll get the fix to keep you safe.Applying patches and updates:Make sure you apply updates for your operating system, web browsers. and software (especially security software) whenever they’re available.Go into the settings for your computer operating system and web browser to make sure they update automatically. Having auto-updates lets you know you're protected against the latest threats from malware and viruses.The internet of things:As more and more things become computerized (watches, appliances, cars, toys), it’s important to apply smart security thinking.Don’t connect if you don’t need to. Just because your fridge or bed can be connected to the Internet doesn’t mean you have to do that. If you do not see a benefit, don’t connect.Change the password right away on every device from the manufacturer’s default. The same password rules apply for things — use a strong password and make it unique.If you can, set the software to check for updates about every three months. You can also set a reminder and check for updates yourself.Connect your things through your guest Wi-Fi network (if you have one). This separates them from the home network where your important data is stored.The City's Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) strives to engage, empower, and improve life for residents in the City through technology. The focus areas of their work includes digital engagement and services, data and analytics, and broadband, cable and digital equity. The department oversees the development and implementation of new digital tools, open data, Wicked Free Wi-Fi, mobile apps, and cyber security practices.\", 'BOSTON - Wednesday, October 2, 2019 - Mayor Martin J.

The department is responsible for 217 parks, playgrounds and athletic fields, two golf courses, 65 squares, 17 fountains, 75 game courts, 16 historic and three active cemeteries, urban wilds, four High School Athletic Fields, and approximately 125,000 trees, all covering 2,346 acres, 1,000 of which comprise the historic Emerald Necklace. Parks and Recreation is also responsible for more than 35,000 street trees.###', 'BOSTON - Tuesday, October 1, 2019 - Building on his Administration\\'s commitment to creating more housing at all income levels to meet the needs of a growing city, Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced that Boston has surpassed 30,000 units permitted under the administration\\'s housing plan,\\xa0\\xa0Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030.\\xa0This includes more than 6,000 income-restricted units, or 20 percent of the total new housing, which is set aside for residents who have qualifying incomes. This is a significant milestone reached in the work to create 69,000 new units of housing by the year 2030, as called for in the City\\'s housing plan. In addition, the administration announced that rental listing prices are stabilizing across the board, based on analysis over the last 18 months.\"Boston\\'s working families are the backbone of our city, and helped build Boston into the diverse, welcoming city we are today,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"In Boston, we\\'re growing faster than any time in the last 50 years, and it\\'s important that our housing production keeps pace to support our middle class. My priority is to ensure everyone can stay in the neighborhoods they love, and continue to call Boston home. I\\'m proud of the progress we\\'ve made and the milestones we\\'ve reached, which reflects a lot of hard work and strong partnerships in the housing community. We\\'ll continue to work together with our partners to add affordable housing, and make Boston a place for all.\"\\xa0Boston continues to lead in creating affordable housing, with one in five units of Boston\\'s total housing stock and one in four of its rental housing stock made up of deed-restricted affordable units. Of those deed-restricted units, nearly half are affordable to families making less than 60 percent of Area Median Income (AMI), or a household income of approximately $57,000 for two people, or $64,000 for a family of three.\\xa0\\xa0As Boston continues to make strides towards creating more affordable housing, City officials continue to work with regional partners to ensure housing, including multi-family housing, is built through the\\xa0\\xa0Metro Mayor\\'s Regional Housing Task Force.\\xa0Mayor Walsh and the Task Force worked together to create their regional housing production goal, which aims to create 185,000 new units of housing across the region by the year 2030.\\xa0Out of 21 municipalities, from 2011 to 2018, 62 percent of all units permitted were in Boston. For comparison, in that same time period, the City of Cambridge permitted one unit for every 7 units that Boston permitted. Another 22 percent of the permitted units were from five neighboring municipalities: Cambridge, Watertown, Everett, Chelsea and Somerville. Five cities, plus Boston, accounted for 84 percent of all units permitted during those seven years.\\xa0\"For Greater Boston employers to continue to be able to attract and retain a talented workforce, it is critical that we support the creation of affordable and accessible housing options,\" said James E. Rooney, President and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. \"I applaud the Walsh Administration for the significant progress that has been made to create a range of new housing opportunities and to maintain Boston\\'s competitive edge. The Chamber and our members look forward to continued partnership with the administration and leaders throughout the region to achieve Mayor Walsh\\'s ambitious housing goals.\"\"Exceeding the 30,000-mark reflects the City of Boston\\'s consistent focus on housing. Boston sets an example for other communities about what it takes to get things done,\" said Clark Ziegler, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership. \"We applaud Boston\\'s emphasis on affordability and transit oriented housing and look forward to seeing the city hit its next milestone.\"Of Boston\\'s total 30,442 permitted units, more than half were for projects outside of Boston\\'s downtown core. Recent permits data show that 81 percent of the permits pulled so far in 2019 are for projects in Boston\\'s neighborhoods outside the downtown core. One in four of the total 30,442 permitted units represent homeownership opportunities, with a little more than half of those being one bedroom or smaller, and the other half being two-bedroom units or larger. When completed, the 30,442 new units are expected to accommodate more than 60,534 residents.The City of Boston continues to focus on building transit-oriented housing units. Of the permitted units,\\xa0nearly two out of three are highly transit accessible and within ¼ mile or a five minute walk to major transit, and three out of four units are within ½ mile or a 10 minute walk from a T stop or commuter rail.\\xa0\"I congratulate Mayor Walsh, Chief Dillon and the City of Boston for reaching this important milestone, of permitting 30,000 new homes, including 6,000 deed-restricted homes,\" said MassHousing Executive Director Chrystal Kornegay. \"Boston is a national leader in planning for housing growth, and MassHousing is proud to have the City of Boston as our partner. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively, to build a Commonwealth where residents of all means can live, and thrive.\"In addition, Boston\\'s strategy of increasing our overall supply of housing units is beginning to show a stabilizing effect on the housing market. Year over year rental listing data from 2017 and 2018 in Boston shows rents increasing by 2.7 percent in older housing stock, and 3.3 percent in all housing, including newly built stock.\\xa0Boston has been trending away from large year-over-year increases in rent costs for several quarters as development catches up with demand, creating more rental opportunities across the City. This trend is continuing in 2019: a year over year comparison of the first two quarters in 2018 and 2019 show rent prices incrementally increasing by 1.7 percent in older housing stock, with a 1.5 percent increase in all housing stock.To accomplish the goals set out in our housing plan, the City of Boston has secured funding to build affordable housing by utilizing a range of tools, including leveraging market-rate development, collecting Linkage and Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) payments from real estate developers, supporting passage of the Community Preservation Act (CPA) to generate approximately $20 million per year, and successfully applying for funding rounds to acquire additional financial support. The City has invested more than $164 million in funding to create the subsidized housing units in cooperation with the state and other housing entities. To find suitable space for new development, the City has also made three million square feet of real estate available.Included in the 69,000 new units called for in the city\\'s housing plan, 15,820 will be income-restricted units, elevating Boston\\'s total income-restricted inventory to 70,000, which maintains Boston\\'s current one in five ratio of deed-restricted affordable housing to all housing units in Boston. In addition, the plan sets a goal to preserve 85 percent of Boston\\'s most at-risk privately-owned affordable units, and purchase 1,000 units of rental housing stock from the speculative market for perpetuity.\\xa0\\xa0Guided by Imagine Boston 2030, and in response to the population growth and development pressure many neighborhoods are facing, the Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA) has planning studies underway across the City, including\\xa0\\xa0Dorchester\\'s Glover\\'s Corner,Allston-Brighton\\'s Western Avenue, Charlestown\\'s Rutherford Avenue Corridor,\\xa0Downtown Boston,\\xa0East Boston,\\xa0Mattapan\\xa0and\\xa0Newmarket. The goal of each study is to work with the community to create a comprehensive vision for the areas, guiding future growth and investment that is equitable for all. Planning guidelines have been passed for\\xa0PLAN: Jamaica Plain/Roxbury,\\xa0PLAN: South Boston Dorchester Avenue\\xa0and\\xa0\\xa0PLAN: Dudley Square\\xa0in Roxbury.\\xa0Mayor Walsh\\'s 2019\\xa0housing security legislative package\\xa0focuses on expanding upon the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis and displacement risks for tenants by proposing strengthening current tools and proposing new ones. The housing security bills proposed seek to help existing tenants, with protections for the elderly, right to counsel for those facing eviction and right of first refusal for tenants to purchase their own building. These proposals, if passed, will provide significant new protections and increased housing stability for renters in the City.###', 'Breast cancer is an epidemic that continues to be a major health crisis in the United States.

With the recent release of our marriage certificates application, we’ve successfully moved all requests for Registry Department vital record certificates — birth, marriage, and death — online. Instead of coming into City Hall or breaking out your stamp collection, you can order from home and receive a certificate in the mail. At just $14 per order, plus a minor processing fee, we’ve been able to not only make our certificates accessible, but also more affordable.In fact, in just the first week of releasing our marriage application — and without any promotion — online requests made up nearly 26 percent of all orders. In that same week, online requests made up 31 percent of birth certificate orders and a whopping 54 percent of death certificate orders. One stat we’re extremely proud of is around our death certificates application, the first that we built for the Registry Department. After being available to the public for more than a year, our online form is the most popular way to make a death certificate request.Thanks to our previous work on birth and death, we took much of the code from those applications to re-use it for marriage certificates. But, marriage had its own specific issues we needed to address.While we were excited to finish off the Registry’s full suite of services, moving marriage certificates online also had a number of added benefits. As with birth and death, there was an online option through the state to order marriage certificates. But, orders cost $42 and up, and certificates weren’t available until six months after the marriage date.As with our other applications, we were also looking to create a more efficient system for the Registry Department. Instead of sifting through the mail and managing in-person orders, our online system would allow Registry staff to quickly process requests. Our goal is to save the Registry Department money and time, time that could be used helping those with special needs, or other projects to make its department even more efficient.And, just like with birth certificates, we knew the demand for marriage certificates would be on the rise thanks to the REAL ID Act. The federal act mandated an “enhanced driver’s license” be issued separate from standard licenses to citizens. You’ll soon need either this enhanced driver’s license or a passport to enter certain federal buildings and to fly in the United States.After the REAL ID requirements were announced in March 2018, the Registry Department saw a 30 percent spike just with birth certificate requests. If you changed your name after you were married, you’re also required to show the Registry of Motor Vehicles your marriage certificate to verify that name change.Let’s face it, some people have trouble remembering their exact marriage date (we’re not pointing any fingers). In talking with Registry staff, we realized how important it would be to allow users to add a date range. The Registry Department receives calls all the time from people needing help finding the date of their marriage. Limiting a person to a single date could easily return no results and create a lot of frustration. By adding a date range, we would help cut down on phone calls, all while creating a more friendly experience for our users.One other issue to address was the use of names. Registry staff often receive calls from folks using alternate spellings, making it tough to track down their records. In our online application, we wanted to give users the option to include extra information, including any alternate spellings of names.Similar to birth certificates, we knew we would also have to deal with restricted records. If either person in a couple had parents who were not married at the time of their birth, their marriage record as well as their birth record are restricted. A restricted marriage certificate means that only the two parties who got married and their parents can access their certificate. Just like with birth, built in a way to upload identification to deal with restricted record requests.We had some initial ideas, but we wanted to make sure to user test our new application as soon as possible. To do this, we created five versions of the application, each with slight variations, and brought them down to the Registry windows to get real-time feedback from users. We also tested with users just outside of City Hall at Patios.After looking at the results from testing, it was clear that we were going to need to use progressive disclosure for adding the date. Progressive disclosure means we give our users just enough information to move forward with the task, without bogging them down with other — potentially confusing — details. We chose to do this because there was still confusion about what to do if you didn’t know the exact date. Using progressive disclosure allowed us to break down the process to funnel people in the right direction. If they know the specific date, they can enter it. If not, we give them the ability to input a range.We also decided to put an alternative spelling box, with the option of adding more than one, on every page where you enter a name. This box allows people to enter any other spellings that might exist for their names. Our first two days of testing revealed that most people were able to add that extra information with ease.After receiving that initial round of feedback, we made updates to the form and performed a second round of testing. We focused on two things: our progressive disclosure process for the date and our alternative names box. Thanks to some more explicit instructions, this round of testing went very well, confirming our suspicions about how best to display information. We decided to incorporate both features for the date and name fields into the final version of the application.We cannot thank the Registry Department enough for their support throughout this process. Registrar Patty McMahon and her staff were with us through every step of the development of our online applications, and we would have been lost without them. They’ve also done an amazing job in spreading the word about online requests.If you have some time, please check out our birth, marriage, and death certificate applications. These are by no means finished products, and we plan to continue to iterate and improve them over time.

Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker\\xa0joined Hearth President and CEO Mark Hinderlie, D.F. Pray President, Scott Pray, the Hearth Board of Directors, local elected officials, and residents to celebrate the groundbreaking of Hearth at Four Corners. The $19 million project will create 54 units of supportive, affordable housing for older adults, and will be located on a previously vacant city-owned lot at 16 Ronald Street in Dorchester. Today\\'s groundbreaking ceremony builds on the City of Boston\\'s commitment to creating more affordable housing, especially for older residents.\\xa0\"As a city, we measure our success by how we are able to serve all of our people, including our most vulnerable residents. We\\'re excited about the Hearth at Four Corners project and the new affordable housing opportunities it brings for Boston\\'s older adults,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This project is another example of our commitment to maintaining and growing our affordable housing stock in Boston. I want to thank all partners involved for making this opportunity possible, which will make a positive difference in the lives of those who will call Hearth home.\"Hearth at Four Corners will create 52 affordable one bedroom units, and two studio apartments. All residents at the new 48,867 square foot building will have 24/7 access to on-site concierge services and a Resident Service Coordinator. Additional wellness services will also be available once construction is complete. The new housing development will serve individuals age 62 or older who have either low or middle-income housing needs. In addition, two units will be set aside to house formerly homeless individuals.\\xa0\"Our administration has prioritized the production and preservation of affordable housing across the Commonwealth, and we are pleased to support this development that brings critical senior housing to the City of Boston,\" said Governor Charlie Baker. \"We will continue to invest in projects that combine housing and important wraparound services, and we look forward to working with our colleagues in the Legislature to pass our Housing Choice bill to facilitate the production of new housing to address Massachusetts\\' affordability and availability crisis.\"Hearth\\'s construction plans call for the highest standards of universal design throughout the new building to accommodate older adults of all abilities. The building will meet LEED Silver, Energy Star, and Enterprise Green Community standards. Financing for the project includes support from the City of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, and State, Federal low income housing tax credits, MassDevelopment, Citizens, and Eastern Bank. Philanthropic support was provided by Charles H. Farnsworth Trust, Charlesbank Homes, and individual donors.\"Hearth feels so fortunate that here in Boston we have a Mayor and a Governor who believe so strongly that all our residents deserve a place to call home. Mayors and Governors oversee critically important agencies charged with addressing the crisis in affordable housing, and this project wouldn\\'t have happened without them, but this Mayor and this Governor have gone beyond simply good management to provide inspirational and philanthropic leadership to make sure we succeed in ending and preventing homelessness in the Commonwealth and our City,\" said Mark Hinderlie, Hearth President and CEO.This project received support from the community led by the City of Boston\\'s Department of Neighborhood Development, and the Erie Ellington Brinsley Neighborhood Association. The new building will be located at the former Ronald Gibson School, and will be steps from the MBTA Fairmount line. Hearth has begun construction with their contractor D.F. Pray, and they anticipate completion of construction and the beginning of lease up by late summer 2020.\\xa0\\xa0In the past five years, almost 430 units for older residents have either been completed, or are currently in construction -- 81 percent of which are income-restricted units. In addition, the City has six more developments in the pipeline that will create 270 more units for older residents.\\xa0Today\\'s groundbreaking for Hearth at Four Corners strongly aligns with the City\\'s housing goals to use more City-owned land to produce affordable housing for seniors as outlined in\\xa0Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030. Mayor Walsh recently increased the City\\'s overall housing targets from 53,000 to 69,000 new units by 2030 to meet Boston\\'s population growth. These updated housing goals build on Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to increasing access to home ownership, preventing displacement and promoting fair and equitable housing access.Since the release of the original Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030 plan in 2014, income-restricted housing stock has grown along with overall new production resulting in nearly 20 percent of newly-developed housing units designated as income restricted, and 25 percent of rental units designated as income restricted. Based on the Mayor\\'s housing plan, in total, after creating an additional 15,820 units of income-restricted housing, Boston will have nearly 70,000 units of income-restricted housing by 2030.Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa02019 housing security legislative package\\xa0\\xa0focuses on expanding upon the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis and displacement risks for tenants by proposing new and strengthening current tools to leverage Boston\\'s prosperity and create sustainable wealth opportunities that make Boston a more inclusive and equitable city. The housing security bills proposed seek to help existing tenants, particularly older adults, remain in their homes, and creates additional funding for affordable housing.For more information on the City\\'s work to create more housing, please visit:\\xa0Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030.About Hearth, Inc.Founded in 1991 as a nonprofit with a mission to end elder homelessness, Hearth has developed 228 units of housing, including Hearth at Four Corners.\\xa0 They have placed over 2,500 older adults in safe housing with appropriate services, both in Hearth housing and through their Outreach Program, and created a National Leadership Initiative, which has resulted in tens of thousands of units of permanent supportive housing for homeless and at-risk older adults coast to coast.Rendering of the Hearth at Four Corners development###', 'Hundreds of illuminated jack-o’-lanterns will be floated on the water accompanied by spooky family activities.

Walsh today joined residents, community advocates, business owners and city officials for a ribbon cutting celebrating the reconstruction of North Square in the North End. A partnership between Boston\\'s Public Works Department and the Boston Art Commission, the project includes a new piece of permanent public art entitled \\'North Square Stories\\', by A+J Art+Design.\\xa0\"The renovation of North Square showcases our commitment to making upgrades to Boston\\'s infrastructure, while still preserving the history and culture of our neighborhoods,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"By working hand-in-hand with the community and incorporating their ideas into the design, we have built a better, more accessible space for residents and visitors to gather and enjoy the North End, and these new works of art, designed for all.\"\\xa0The community design process for the reconstruction of North Square began in 2014, and priorities resulting from those discussions led to the final design.

We hope the research and level of detail that went into\\xa0North Square Stories\\xa0leads to a deeper experience of North Square for the local and visitor alike, and we hope that there is always something more to see.\"The artwork honors the historical legacy of North Square and enhances its functionality as a community gathering place and tourist destination. A+J Art+Design built strong ties with community members as a basis for creating the artwork, and worked with students from Eliot School and St. John School to incorporate students\\' artwork into the sculptures.\\xa0\"The recent reconstruction of North Square successfully blends old and new in this deeply historic gathering space. The new, wonderfully evocative bronze sculptures capture moments in North End history and offer a moving and educational treat for visitors and locals alike,\" said Nina Zanierri, Executive Director of the Paul Revere House.Under Mayor Walsh, the Public Works Department is repairing critical roads and bridges, such as the North Washington Street Bridge, and the Dana Avenue Bridge.

Walsh today announced the launch of the first Age Strong Commission public awareness campaign, aimed at revealing implicit biases around aging and dispelling stereotypes about older adults to promote more positive messaging around aging.\\xa0The campaign launch comes after the City\\'s\\xa0Age Strong Commission\\xa0updated its name and brand earlier this year, and redefined its mission and values reflecting a growing trend and national movement towards more inclusive aging language and actions.\\xa0\"Boston\\'s older residents are strong in so many different ways -- with strong experiences, cultures, and voices,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"We want to evolve the conversation around aging and make sure that the images and stories we share help expand what it means to age in our city. Older Bostonians bring so many dynamic experiences to our community, and we want more people to see that and embrace it.\"The multifaceted campaign features eight older Bostonians who defy negative stereotypes about aging. In the\\xa0advertisements, the models stand boldly under labels that often get placed on older people: frumpy, cranky, inactive, senile, frail, childish, over the hill, and helpless -- and their stories counter those biases. The advertisements will be featured across the city on bus shelters, in Boston Public Library locations, in a 30-second television commercial, and on digital signage through this fall.\\xa0The Age Strong Commission has actively engaged with the community to learn how Bostonians are aging now and what their hopes are for aging in the future. Those conversations reflect a growing trend and national movement towards more inclusive aging language and actions, designed by the FrameWorks Institute, the research partner for the\\xa0Reframing Aging Project.\"The stories of real people matter. Boston\\'s reframing aging campaign challenges us to rethink older people and the words we use,\" said Nora Moreno Cargie, president of Tufts Health Plan Foundation and vice president for corporate citizenship at Tufts Health Plan. \"This is one of many actions already taken by the city. It is adapting its systems and programs to be relevant for older people and include our voices, our stories, our experiences in solutions.

The sculpture was moved in 2014 when the Pru began construction on a new entrance on Boylston Street.Created by Donald DeLue, the Boston Art Commission describes “Quest Eternal” this way: \"Twisted in a dramatic pose, this 27-foot tall male figure reaches toward the sky. The muscular nude brings to mind ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, as well as the work of Renaissance-era artists, who often looked to classical art to inspire their choice of subject matter and style. Here, the sculpture also fits in with the modern urban landscape and parallels the bold verticality of the neighboring Prudential Tower, completed three years before the sculpture’s installation.\"During this week’s Council meeting, the Council voted to approve the acceptance of the donation of the sculpture from Boston Properties. It will be moved to Smith Playground in Allston as part of the park redesign.', \"Speaking in regards to the resolution, Councilor Essaibi-George said, “I think it's important to recognize the men and women both uniformed and civilian employees that are doing the work – our Boston Police Crime Lab in particular.

Additionally, there will be a cafe and community space for writers, a podcast studio and multiple classrooms to expand GrubStreet\\'s workshops. There will also be an event space for readings, slam poetry, storytelling events and shows that combine words with music and dance. Currently, the nonprofit organization operates programs at its Downtown location, and in neighborhoods including Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan and East Boston. This new location will allow GrubStreet to expand its programming and activate a collaborative space in the South Boston Waterfront.\"With this move, we look forward to becoming a dynamic gathering place for writers and readers of all ages, backgrounds and abilities,\" said Eve Bridburg, Founder and Executive Director of GrubStreet. \"GrubStreet\\'s new home will provide a space to learn, to share stories, to see dynamic performances, to celebrate book launches, and to make friends.\"\\xa0\\nThe selection of GrubStreet follows a public and transparent process to select civic or cultural users to activate available spaces in development in ways that serve a diverse population. Following the release of a Request for Ideas (RFI) in January 2018, the BPDA received eight proposals, and in April 2018 hosted an open house where the top four respondents presented their proposals to the public. The selection process is modeled after an effort completed in 2015 when the Society of Arts and Crafts was selected as an operator of similar space provided at Pier 4.The selection committee represented multiple departments across the City and considered criteria including public comment letters, the ability of the respondent to create a welcoming space that serves a diverse population, and access to the financial resources to build-out and operate space year-round.The announcement builds on Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0Boston Creates Cultural Plan, a ten-year city initiative designed to align public and private resources to strengthen cultural vitality over the long-term, and weave arts and culture into the fabric of everyday life.

In addition to her academic pursuits, Dr. Cain has worked with local nonprofit organizations and institutions on evaluation and research projects that focus on a range of issues, including economic development, racial equity, and displacement. Dr. Cain fell \\'in curiosity\\' with Boston during her first few years of graduate school as she experienced the city and its neighborhoods through different forms of public transportation. Deeply intrigued by how people move through and experience place, Dr. Cain brings a sociological imagination to addressing the challenges of ensuring that Boston is a city that grows inclusively.\\xa0\"Since its inception, the Housing Innovation Lab has infused a sense of curiosity, creativity, and the lived experiences of Boston residents into our conversations about housing,\" said Dr. Cain. \"As the new director, I cannot wait to grow the threads of this work.

Walsh today announced the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) is proposing regulations aimed at addressing vaping and tobacco use among youth in Boston. Under the proposal, mint and menthol nicotine and tobacco products will only be sold only in verified adult-only tobacco retailers. Staff will now move forward with an engagement process that will include a public comment period and public hearing before a Board of Health vote to approve the amendments.\\xa0\"Teen vaping is an epidemic that is particularly alarming because we know that nicotine use at a young age can have the power to lead to a lifelong dependency. The data is undeniable in showing that these amendments would save lives,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I believe that now is the time to act, and I thank our public health staff for bringing forward a proposal that will ensure Boston has some of the strongest regulations in the country to protect our young people.\"Boston continues to be a leader at taking steps at the local level to restrict youth access to tobacco and other nicotine products such as e-cigarettes, vapes and \"e-juice,\" making it among the first jurisdictions in the United States to regulate e-cigarettes and other nicotine products on equal footing with tobacco. In 2015, the Board of Health increased the sales age for nicotine and tobacco products to 21 and restricted the sale of the majority of flavored tobacco and nicotine products to adult-only tobacco retail locations.\\xa0\"On behalf of the Board of Health, I am excited that we are moving to address both the long-standing issue of menthol tobacco use as well as the rapidly-emerging issue of youth nicotine use and vaping,\" said Manny Lopes, chairman of the Board of Health and chief executive officer of East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC). \"I applaud Mayor Walsh\\'s leadership on this pressing public health issue and look forward to engaging with the community during the public comment period.\"Because most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, its use increases the possibility of addiction, particularly to other tobacco products that can cause well-documented health consequences. Vaping products can also cause long-term harm to brain development and respiratory health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among high school students who use e-cigarettes, use of any flavored e-cigarettes in 2018 was over 67 percent, and the current use of menthol- or mint-flavored e-cigarettes was over 51 percent.\\xa0The proposed regulatory amendments also seek to address long-standing disparities in tobacco use patterns and associated mortality from diseases such as heart disease, cancer and stroke. BPHC researchers found that among adults in Boston, black adults suffer the greatest burden of tobacco-related mortality of any ethnic or racial group. Tobacco use is a major contributor to the three leading causes of death among African Americans - heart disease, cancer and stroke.In addition to removing the exemption, the proposal strengthens retailer ID checking requirements and restricts the sale of products that attract young people. BPHC is also supporting Boston Public Schools in efforts to launch a district-wide public awareness prevention campaign focused on youth smoking and vaping, professional development training for teachers and staff, a comprehensive health education curriculum, and referrals to smoking cessation programs.The Mayor\\'s Office of Health and Human Services and BPHC joined with the Codman Square Neighborhood Council and B.O.L.D. Teens to host a community forum on menthol tobacco and vaping in July 2019. More than 150 people, mostly youth, joined together for a conversation about the ways tobacco and nicotine use negatively impacted their health and their communities.\\xa0\"Regulatory changes made over the last decade, combined with efforts to build strong partnerships with schools, health centers and other community organizations, have played important roles in reducing smoking among Boston residents,\" said Boston Public Health Commission Executive Director Monica Valdes Lupi. \"The marketing and retail practices of tobacco companies that have been used for decades to infiltrate our communities of color with menthol tobacco products are unacceptable, and the fact that similar tactics are being used now to target our kids with vaping products demands action.\"Further restricting the sale of menthol tobacco products would likely reduce tobacco use overall and particularly in communities of color, potentially reducing disparities in disease and premature death between Boston neighborhoods, and advancing Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0Imagine Boston 2030\\xa0goal of reducing disparities in premature mortality between Boston neighborhoods.With the Board\\'s recommendation to proceed, staff will now start a public engagement process that will include a public hearing on November 7 and a public comment period through November 8, 2019.

Walsh, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph E. Finn, and members of the community gathered today to celebrate the groundbreaking of the first new firehouse built in Boston in over 30 years. The groundbreaking of Engine 42, Rescue 2, District 9 Firehouse, represents a $23.5 million investment for the City of Boston and Roxbury. The City of Boston Public Facilities Department (PFD) in collaboration with the Boston Fire Department (BFD) worked closely with Dore & Whittier Architects to design a 21st century firehouse that provides the best emergency response services to Roxbury, with a focus on the health and wellness of Boston\\'s firefighters.\\xa0\"Boston\\'s first responders work each and every day to protect Boston\\'s residents, and as a City, we want to support the health, wellness and safety of those who do the same for us,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Through its innovative design, this new firehouse will make a significant difference in the health and vitality of our firefighters, and I want to thank Commissioner Finn and all our firefighters for their dedication to our city. I look forward to this new investment in Roxbury serving as a point of pride for many years to come.\"\\xa0Mayor Walsh at the groundbreaking celebration of the Engine 42 firehouse.The existing firehouse opened in 1952, and has seen limited capital investment since it was built. The design of the building incorporates the latest methods in protecting Boston firefighters, focusing on health, safety and wellness. The layout of the new building minimizes particulate contaminants from traveling to the living quarters of the building. The new building will be broken into three zones (hot, warm and cold) to keep carcinogens from circulating throughout the house.\"The City of Boston Fire Department is one of the best in the country, and Mayor Walsh is investing in the lifesaving work my firefighters do every day,\" said Commissioner Finn. \"The investments Mayor Walsh is making in our firehouses, along with purchasing new apparatus, and providing additional training will not only support our firefighters, but give them the tools to better protect the residents of the City of Boston. Cases of occupational related cancer are occurring on an almost weekly basis, the measures taken in the design of this building will help protect the firefighters who put their lives on the line for this City.\"The future\\xa0Engine 42, Rescue 2, District 9 fire house will include:\\xa0\\xa0In addition, the City of Boston is commissioning an artist to create a piece of permanent public art to complement the construction of the Engine 42 fire station. This project has a budget of $300,000, and is funded by the City\\'s Percent for Art program, which commissions one percent of the City\\'s capital borrowing for the creation of public art. $13.4 million has been allocated to this program over the next five years. The artwork at Engine 42 will be a site-specific, impactful, focal design feature that aims to enrich the connection between the Boston Fire Department and the surrounding Egleston and Roxbury communities. The City is currently in the contracting phase with the artist, and will announce who was selected soon.\\xa0In addition to the Engine 42 investment, Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0fiscal year 2020 (FY20) budget\\xa0includes a significant technology investment in new equipment for the fire department, including the replacement of eight fire trucks for a total of 48 over five years, the replacement of bio packs for tunnel rescue and a brush truck which enables the Boston Fire Department to respond to woodland fires. These investments will help ensure BFD has the tools it needs to respond when called upon. The budget provides another year of funding for a $500,000 program to enable industrial-level cleaning of firehouses. Reducing cancer risk for firefighters and supporting firefighter health and safety continues to be one of Mayor Walsh and the Fire Department\\'s top priorities.Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20-24 Capital Plan will include other health and safety improvements to firehouse projects as a result of recent programming. Starting in FY16, the Fire Department, in conjunction with the Public Facilities Department, studied best practices for firehouse design. Key design changes include defined zones within the firehouse to prevent contamination of living areas, along with improved personal and gear cleaning facilities. The results of this planning are reflected in the replacement of firehouses for Engine 42 in Roxbury and Engine 17 in Dorchester, at a total investment of $48 million. In FY20, the study and design phase will start for replacing Engine 3 in the South End and Engine 37 on Huntington Avenue.Earlier this month, the City of Boston was named a\\xa0recipient of an Assistance to Firefighters Grant. Through this grant, Boston received one of 166 Assistance to Firefighters Grants that were awarded to cities and towns nationwide. The grant in the amount of $704,510 will assist the Boston Fire Department with wellness and fitness activities.Construction on Engine 42 will start in the coming weeks. During construction, fire operations will relocate to 121 Amory Street, .2 miles from the existing fire station.Rendering of the Engine 42 fire station.

The project scope,developed by JB Ventures and CBT Architects, calls for the preservation and meticulous restoration of the architecturally significant Massachusetts Avenue and Washington Street facades in addition to\\xa0 the construction of a 13 story tower at the rear of the original structure.Despite the proposed preservation of the street-facing facades, the redevelopment of the Hotel Alexandra is controversial and has prompted both significant support and opposition from the South End community. Preservationists argue that preserving only the facade - commonly known as “facadism” or “facadectomy” -\\xa0 results in the loss of the building’s original intention: the craft of the building’s construction, its original use, and its neighborhood scale. Critics also assert that the construction of a modern hotel tower (at a\\xa0height higher than the 45-foot limit currently allowed by the city’s zoning code) will detract from the character of this portion of the South End/Roxbury streetscape. Although there is disagreement over the best way to preserve the building, both sides can likely agree that the significantly deteriorated state of the building\\xa0 has created an urgent need to salvage what remains of this iconic structure.To understand the rationale of the Commission’s decision, it is important to note\\xa0 the entire context of the Alexandra’s unique condition, specifically that of the interior infrastructure. The building\\xa0 has been abandoned between 40 and 50 years the interior floor plates have the battle scars to prove it. Fire, water, vandals and scrappers have had their way with the property for decades. Preserving and building behind the original facade, while not a best practice, could quite possibly be the last remaining option for the Alexandra. City officials and neighbors alike fear that the landmark will meet the same fate of its former neighbor, the Ivory Bean House. Bostonians will recall that the Ivory Bean house met its date with the wrecking ball in 2011 due to public safety concerns related to the building’s neglect over the years.\\xa0The Commission’s decision to approve the tower addition was not easy there was an extended period of collaboration regarding financial justification, establishing past precedent, and questioning the implications for future precedent. Ultimately, the Commission negotiated a modern architectural addition that maintains the neighborhood street scale utilizing setback, materials and contrast that, when viewed collectively from around the district, are interpreted as two unique structures that emphasize the grandeur of the original architecture. In the end, we as a commission and a community must reflect on the lessons learned from this project should not be forgotten preventative measures to preserve historic structures throughout the city should be taken to prevent similar situations in the future. Intervention by way of “mothballing” and minimum maintenance is paramount to protecting our built heritage for the future. The city’s breakneck pace of development has seen countless examples of older or abandoned structures that were once thought of as outdated are seeing a new life in with the changing ways we live, work and play.', 'The Aberdeen Architectural Conservation District’s (AACD) seemingly chaotic historic development pattern pushes the limits of good design and modern design materials. Coupled with the misconception that new architecture cannot be built to fit into historic neighborhoods, the task of redevelopment can seem daunting for even the most experienced of architects. How do we integrate new construction with the historic styles of yesteryear? The answer lies in the details. Examining materials, facade treatments, set back, landscaping and height are all ways that designers can create new classics, all while contributing to the continuous evolution of historic, human-scaled neighborhoods. The developers of 40 Mount Hood Road were up for the challenge and have done just that.\\xa040 Mount Hood Road is located in\\xa0Boston’s Brighton neighborhood. This often overlooked historic neighborhood is one of the\\xa0most beautiful in Boston, containing winding streets lined with lush landscaped lawns, and a hodgepodge of 19th century single family homes mixed with\\xa0 20th century apartment buildings. Developed originally as a streetcar suburb in the late nineteenth century, the neighborhood grew along with the popular trends and demand: during the nineteenth century many city dwellers desired to relocate outside the dense city core to the tree-lined streets of the suburbs. Today, the neighborhood of Aberdeen maintains a remarkably intact collection of buildings that represent the newly-emerging development patterns of its time.Stantac worked with CWDG and 1650 Commonwealth LLC to carefully craft a proposal for a large-scale residential development with design details that recall historic materials and design that will help the new construction blend harmoniously with the rest of the district. This development, which was approved at the August 2019 Aberdeen Architectural Conservation District, calls for the demolition of an existing non-contributing 1950s motel complex in order to construct a six-floor, 151-unit residential building complete with outdoor public space and 201 below-grade parking spaces. The building stands out amongst typical redevelopment for its utilization of brick, stone, and double-hung windows. The design details on this 75,000-square foot, irregularly-shaped parcel, help preserve the neighborhood scale, character, and sense of place.Designing a new building in a historic district comes with a number of hurdles, several of which involve satisfying the requirements of multiple city regulatory bodies, including the AACDC. To streamline this process, AACDC held several joint advisory design review with the Boston Civic Design Commission in order to be consistent with a direction forward. With input from various city commissions, the former surface parking lots and mismatched motel architecture will soon host\\xa0 new residential structure that evokes the spirit of the surrounding neighborhood all while supplying the city with desperately needed living units for the area’s growing population.', 'Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) received a complete application to demolish the residence at 55 Meyer Street in Roslindale, 02131.We will post each Demo Delay\\xa0application to provide the public with information about proposed demolitions as early as possible in the\\xa0Article 85 process.BLC staff has 10\\xa0days from receiving an application to make a determination about historical, architectural, cultural, or urban design significance.If you have input about the significance of this property, please send to\\xa0BLC staff\\xa0before\\xa05 p.m.\\xa0on\\xa0September 27, 2019.', \"Please join Boston Centers for Youth & Families, and the City of Boston’s Public Facilities Department for an information session about upcoming renovations to the BCYF Curley Community Center in South Boston on Monday, September 30 at 6 p.m.The Walsh Administration's investment to the center will include a $15 million dollar major renovation of the existing building that supports re-programming the interior space and provides resilient protection from future sea level rise.The meeting will be held at BCYF Curley Community Center, M Street entrance, 1663 Columbia Road, South Boston.\", 'BOSTON - Tuesday, September 17, 2019 - Mayor Martin J.

Mayor Walsh recently increased the City\\'s overall housing targets from 53,000 to 69,000 new units by 2030 to meet Boston\\'s population growth. These updated housing goals build on Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to increasing access to home ownership, preventing displacement and promoting fair and equitable housing access.Since the release of the original Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030 plan in 2014, income-restricted housing stock, designed to increase affordable housing, has grown along with overall new production: nearly 20 percent of housing units are income restricted, and 25 percent of rental units are income restricted. In total, after creating an additional 15,820 units of income-restricted housing, Boston will have nearly 70,000 units of income-restricted housing by 2030.Mayor Walsh\\'s 2019\\xa0housing security legislative package\\xa0focuses on expanding upon the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis and displacement risks for tenants by proposing new and strengthening current tools to leverage Boston\\'s prosperity and create sustainable wealth opportunities that make Boston a more inclusive and equitable city.

Walsh today joined members of the Boston City Council, community residents and advocates as he signed \"An Act to Further Leverage Commercial Development to Build Housing, Create Jobs, and Preserve Inclusionary Development.\" This Home Rule Petition enables the City of Boston to have more flexibility to fund affordable housing and workforce training through Boston\\'s Linkage program, and will codify the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) into Boston\\'s Zoning Code to protect the City\\'s ability to create and fund income-restricted housing. Mayor Walsh proposed the Home Rule Petition in January 2019 as part of his\\xa02019-2020 legislative package. Following the signing, the proposal will move to the Massachusetts Legislature for approval.\\xa0\"We must use every tool we have to leverage Boston\\'s growth to invest in affordable housing and workforce training for our residents,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I am proud to sign this legislation that addresses one of our most pressing issues in Boston: building more opportunities for all. I thank the City Council and many advocates for helping us take this critical step forward, and look forward to working with the Legislature to quickly move this bill into law.\"\\xa0Boston\\'s Linkage program provides funding for affordable housing and workforce training through payments by large-scale commercial real estate development. Under the current law, the Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA) is only allowed to adjust Linkage every three years based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Currently, commercial developments over 100,000 square feet pay $10.81 per square foot for housing and jobs Linkage. The money collected is made available through competitive funding rounds administered by the Neighborhood Housing Trust and the City of Boston\\'s Office of Workforce Development.\\xa0\\xa0The Home Rule Petition signed today will allow Boston to make adjustments to the required payment and program guidelines, including annual adjustments, allowing for Linkage to be more closely aligned with the market and offering additional opportunities for the creation of affordable housing and workforce development.Since 2014, the City has invested $43 million in housing funding from Linkage that it has leveraged for a total of $723 million in additional public funds across 66 developments. Those projects have created 1,546 new affordable units and preserved 749 existing affordable units. Between 2015 and 2016, Linkage helped more than 2,300 low- and moderate-income residents access job training and education programs. After job placement, graduates of the training programs earned an average wage of $15.23 per hour with 72 percent earning benefits as well.\"Housing our communities and preparing residents for economic prosperity are critical priorities for the City of Boston,\" said City Councilor Lydia Edwards. \"This legislation will ensure Boston secures lasting affordability for those who live here today as we plan for growth and development in Boston neighborhoods.\"\"Throughout the legislative process, my City Council colleagues and I heard from a range of stakeholders who expressed how this Home Rule Petition would be a specific tool to address the housing crisis in Boston,\" said City Councilor Michael Flaherty. \"This legislation will enable Boston to update the Linkage exaction rates on an annual basis to allow for the City to make adjustments based on the realities of the real estate market. Giving the City more flexibility and local control over the exaction rates is especially important so as we continue to go through an\\xa0 era of rapid growth and development. I join Mayor Walsh and my Council colleagues in advocating to move this bill forward.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The bill will now be considered by the State Legislature. Representative Kevin\\xa0Honan\\xa0of Allston-Brighton and the Chair of the Joint Committee on Housing, will be filing the bill. Representative\\xa0Honan\\xa0said, “Linkage fees are a critical tool that help to ensure that the benefits of the city’s success are shared by everyone. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Housing, I am thrilled to see the city’s continued commitment to affordable housing.”\\xa0The Home Rule Petition also codifies Boston\\'s Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) into the Boston Zoning Code. Under the current law, IDP requires that developers of buildings with 10 or more units seeking zoning relief or building on City of Boston owned land set aside a percentage of their on-site units as income-restricted, create off-site income-restricted units, or make a payment to the IDP fund. As the BPDA completes comprehensive planning in Boston\\'s neighborhoods and updates Boston\\'s existing zoning, more market rate residential projects may become as of right and be exempt from IDP requirements. The Home Rule Petition strengthens Boston\\'s IDP as a strategy to capture affordable housing units and funding from projects which are zoning compliant, expanding the work under Mayor Walsh to create and preserve Boston\\'s affordable housing.\\xa0\"Workforce development and economic mobility go hand in hand in helping people achieve\\xa0economic self-sufficiency,\" said Joanne Hilferty, President and CEO of Morgan Memorial\\xa0Goodwill Industries, which operates MassHire Boston Career Center, and provides job training\\xa0and career services for 7,500 individuals annually. \"We applaud Mayor Walsh and the Boston\\xa0City Council for their work on strengthening the Linkage Program to create more access to job\\xa0training and career services for those who need it most.\"Since the inception of IDP in 2000, the policy has resulted in 2,706 units of stable, income-restricted housing for moderate- and middle-income families, and $154 million in funding. When combined with other affordable housing resources, this funding has supported the completion or preservation of 2,006 additional units of housing, affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.\"It is important that the City continues to increase affordable housing options for Boston\\'s households that are rent burdened,\" said Karen Chen, Executive Director of the Chinatown Progressive Association. \"We need to do everything we can to ensure that our low-income residents can remain in their neighborhoods, near their jobs, schools and families. I want to thank the Mayor and the City Council for passing this important home-rule petition and commit that the IDP and Linkage coalitions will work hard to get this bill passed at the State.\"The BPDA is currently working with outside consultants, the development community and housing and job advocates to explore policy changes to both Linkage and IDP beyond the legislative changes made in the Home Rule Petition.\\xa0\\xa0The Mayor\\'s commitment to increasing affordable housing in the City is reflected in\\xa0Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030, Boston\\'s latest\\xa0\\xa0quarterly housing report,\\xa0and the City\\'s overall housing goal of 69,000 new units by 2030. These 69,000 new units include 15,820 new income-restricted units, which would elevate Boston\\'s income-restricted inventory total to 70,000, or one in five of all housing units. In addition, the plan set a goal to preserve 85 percent of Boston\\'s most at-risk privately-owned affordable units, and to purchase 1,000 units of rental housing stock from the speculative market and income-restrict them for perpetuity.\\xa0ABOUT MAYOR WALSH\\'S 2019 LEGISLATIVE AGENDAMayor Walsh\\'s legislative agenda continues his administration\\'s work to create greater opportunity for all residents, and serves all people of Massachusetts through its focus on equity.

Walsh and the Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development (OWD) announced $2.2 million has been awarded to 51 community-based programs that will provide employment, education and economic services to more than 4,000 low-income Boston residents. The funds come to the City of Boston through the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). The awards were celebrated yesterday at Black Market in Roxbury, a first-time recipient of CDBG funding.\\xa0“In Boston, we are fortunate to have organizations that are dedicated to creating economic opportunity for everyone,” said Mayor Walsh. “Together, these grants are truly a partnership. By providing these organizations with the funding they need, we are investing in our residents, and taking another step forward in closing the equity gap, creating more opportunities for all.”For this grant cycle OWD prioritized organizations offering services that give residents access to economic opportunity, including employment training and career readiness, youth development programming, essential language access and economic benefits counseling. The organizations represent nearly every neighborhood in Boston and consist of various competitive program models.\\xa0Two organizations are receiving funding for the first time this year. Mothers for Justice & Equality, an organization that empowers mothers and youth to challenge the normalization of violence by becoming catalysts for change in their communities, will leverage their CDBG funds to provide educational civic action programming for mothers and youth in Boston. Black Market, a micro-business accelerator program, will use their CDBG funding to employ local vendors at their pop-up market in Roxbury’s Dudley Square.\\xa0\\xa0“Our community is full of dreamers and innovators that tend to get overlooked and overshadowed because of the zip code in which they reside,” said Kai Grant, owner of Black Market. “This money is an investment for their future and the development of an entire ecosystem in Roxbury. We are grateful to assist in the socio-economic uplifting of our neighborhoods.”Funding was also made available to Adult Basic Education and English Language programs. These programs offer employment-specific language services that can create pathways to employment for lower-wage Boston residents. The Mujeres Unidas Avanzando (MUA), based in Dorchester, trains Latina women at an on-site phlebotomy lab while integrating language services, job readiness and job placement. Another recipient, Greater Boston Legal Services, will provide free legal representation for Boston residents who need to maintain critical benefits such as housing assistance and childcare vouchers.\\xa0\\xa0Recognizing that economic opportunity begins at an early age, Boston Builds Credit, a first-in-the-nation citywide movement to help Boston residents achieve good credit, received CDBG funds to deploy on-site financial coaches at Bunker Hill Community College and Roxbury Community College to help over 400 students with credit building and financial coaching. Of those, 240 students will continue to work one-on-one with qualified coaches to set and attain personal finance goals.\\xa0Other selected programs, such as Beacon Communities Charitable Fund, provide residents with career readiness training. Beacon Communities Charitable Fund, in partnership with Economic Mobility Pathways (EmPath), will use their CDBG funds to offer a Technology Mobility Action Plan initiative (TMAP) at Boston Housing Authority’s Tierney Learning Center in South Boston. TMAP is a career-development and family support program for low-income heads of households seeking employment in the technology field.Grantees were selected through an open and competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) procurement process with input from both the public and private sectors.

Founded in 1998, MOIA gained recognition as a model for other cities. It wasn't until 2008 that offices like MOIA began to grow in number around the country. Today, remains central to Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s vision for Boston. MOIA works to strengtheMOIA n the ability of immigrants in Boston to take part in the city. This includes the economic, civic, social, and cultural life of the city. They also promote the recognition and public understanding of immigrant contributions to Boston.The lens of language and communication access is vital for MOIA to achieve its mission. MOIA serves a unique population. It includes people who live in the diverse Boston boundaries. But it also includes people who come to Boston to work, go to school, shop, and take part in cultural events. Language can be a significant barrier for these constituents. 17.4% of city residents identify as having a language access need in English. This doesn’t even account for the 22.7 million people predicted to visit Boston in 2019.The City must represent and cater to its diverse constituents. An Le is MOIA’s Policy and Communications Advisor. He believes language and communications access must be “an operational function of City government, not a luxury feature.” Le points out that this function is also important for English-speaking immigrants. There are many immigrants who already communicate well in English. But, they may still need clarification for certain information. For example, words such as “justice” can take on many meanings in different situations. Unfamiliar and complex subjects, like immigration, are at risk of mistranslation. Such topics need context to be clearly communicated. MOIA can help clarify these concepts and jargon to Boston constituents.MOIA serves as a main information center for immigrants. They offer multilingual Immigrant Information Centers in libraries and community centers. They host monthly free immigration consultations with volunteer attorneys. Constituents can request free interpretation services for the clinics a week in advance. They also promote public understanding of immigrant contributions to Boston. MOIA’s “To Immigrants With Love” program is city-wide. It shares stories of immigrants and encourages civic involvement.The first step towards language access in Boston took place through MOIA. Before the 2016 law, MOIA managed two very well known resources. These are the LCA Volunteer Pool and the Professional Vendor Directory. Departments often reached out to MOIA when language services were in need. In 2016, the Mayor wanted to think about language and disability access in a more strategic way. After the 2016 ordinance became law, the LCA team began to plan and create resources. LCA extends tools, trainings and information across all departments. Now, departments no longer need to refer language access cases to MOIA. The City has made a united effort to increase language and communications access. City offices now use translation and interpretation services in their everyday operations. They can respond to in-person interpretation requests, including ASL and Deaf Interpreters. They also have access to Video Remote Interpretation (VRI) for walk-ins. Or, Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) for longer meetings.MOIA also partners with community organizations to serve constituents. On September 28, hundreds of people will be at Roxbury Crossing for Citizenship Day. This annual event attracts over 350 applicants for U.S. citizenship. Since 2014, 1,444 applicants\\xa0 submitted applications on Citizenship Day. Over 350 volunteers, law students, and attorneys are also expected to show. In a city where 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, this event matters.Language and communications access are crucial for a successful Citizenship Day. U.S. citizenship applications must be completed in English. Certain applicants aged 50 years or older may be eligible for language exemptions. These are the “50/20” and “55/15” exemptions. But all other applicants must fill out the application themselves in English.\\xa0 Multilingual volunteers pre-screen applicants for the required level of English. They also fulfill American Sign Language (ASL) and Certified Deaf Interpreter requests. Applicants who need more English skills receive information on learning resources.As a collaborating partner, MOIA manages event outreach. They design multilingual materials and advertise the English-language rule to potential applicants. MOIA collaborates with local ethnic media outlets to promote the event. On previous Citizenship Days, some immigrant groups have had lower representation. MOIA addresses this by working with local community groups for outreach support. MOIA even sends out translated appointment reminders to applicants through the AlertBoston system. MOIA and Project Citizenship work together to pool resources. Thus, they are able to plan a united approach.\\xa0Events like Citizenship Day are important. They show that planning is essential to successful engagement. They show the importance of collaboration. And they show the value of language and communications access. As such, MOIA aims to continue such efforts and programs. They will be a continued presence within the immigrant community and City of Boston as a whole.\\xa0The Office of Language and Communication Access works to strengthen the City of Boston so that services, programs and activities are meaningfully accessible to all constituents.

Walsh today announced the citywide expansion of\\xa0Boston Saves, the City of Boston\\'s children\\'s savings account program, to all K2 kindergartners enrolled in Boston Public Schools (BPS). The program will provide each student with an account automatically seeded with $50 that can be used to support their future college or career training.\"Throughout its three-year pilot program, Boston Saves has proven to be an essential part of providing families with the tools to save for their children\\'s post-secondary future,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I am pleased to announce the citywide expansion of Boston Saves, providing more families with these resources and strengthening the investment we are making in Boston\\'s youth.\"\\xa0\"Every child deserves to hear the message \\'We believe in you and you can do anything\\' from the first minute they walk through our school doors,\" said Boston Public Schools Superintendent Brenda Cassellius. \"The Boston Saves program helps us send that message and is a valuable resource to help families get a jump start on planning for their child\\'s future. I encourage every family whose child is entering kindergarten this year to participate so they can take advantage of all of the wonderful benefits of the program.\"Boston Saves aims to increase college and career access by supporting families in saving and planning for their children\\'s futures. In addition to a children\\'s savings account, Boston Saves also provides opportunities for families to earn more money for their child, an online platform to track savings progress, and fun community events to make financial saving and planning easier.Starting this fall, each K2 kindergartner enrolled in BPS will automatically receive a Boston Saves account with $50 to help build their future. The money in this account can be used to help pay for the costs of college or career training when a student finishes high school.Research has shown that the mere presence of savings can motivate post-secondary success. In\\xa0one study, low-income children with less than $500 in an account dedicated to higher education were three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate from college. Achievement of this kind is increasingly important in the Boston job market, where approximately 75 percent of positions\\xa0are estimated\\xa0to require\\xa0college or other post-secondary coursework.Families can grow the money in their child\\'s Boston Saves account by earning incentives for specific actions that plan for the future. For example, if a family saves $25 for their child in a three-month period, Boston Saves will add another $5 to their child\\'s account. All told, families can earn up to $65 in incentives for their child\\'s Boston Saves account in the program\\'s first year.\"My family\\'s participation in the Boston Saves program has brought up important family discussions about college and financial planning early on,\" said Esmirna Soto, the parent of a student at Roosevelt School, which participated in the Boston Saves pilot. \"The experience has been great because the earlier we save, the more our child will benefit over time. He benefits by knowing that we are not only expecting him to attend college or some form of higher education, but that we are also financially planning for it.\"Families can view their child\\'s Boston Saves account on an online platform, called the Savings Center, which will open later in Fall 2019. When families use this platform to link their own financial account to their child\\'s Boston Saves account, they will be able to track all their savings for their child in one convenient place online.In addition to these opportunities, Boston Saves also provides ongoing support. Program partners, such as nonprofits and financial institutions, offer resources that simplify academic and educational planning. These resources range from financial education activities for students to college planning and credit-building workshops for their families. Peer support is also available through Family Champions, trusted family members in a school community who are trained by Boston Saves. Family Champions are able to explain the program to fellow families and encourage their saving progress - often in families\\' native languages.\"My experience with Boston Saves has been wonderful, because I have learned a lot,\" said Elsa Flores, a Boston Saves Family Champion. \"I encourage other families about the importance of saving for their children\\'s university or professional training from the time they are young, and thus help them place their children on the right path to succeed in their future lives.\"Boston Saves began in 2016 as a pilot program supported by an $800,000 investment from the Eos Foundation, the City of Boston, and other funders. Over the course of the three-year pilot, Boston Saves provided accounts to 1,600 students from 11 BPS schools. Their families were able to build on the $80,000 in these accounts by earning an additional $15,000 in incentives for their children.\\xa0Boston Saves\\' program design was developed with the input of BPS families, and this family-centered approach is reflected in the program\\'s high participation rate. Over the course of the pilot, nearly half (43 percent) of all eligible families participated in a Boston Saves event.\"We are thrilled with the success of the Boston Saves pilot program and even more impressed by the Mayor\\'s commitment to expanding it district-wide so quickly,\" said Andrea Silbert, president of the Eos Foundation. \"Children\\'s savings accounts beginning in kindergarten are a game-changer.

Walsh today announced a comprehensive review of the city\\'s Zoning Board of Appeal (ZBA) and related processes, in order to ensure that best practices, including strong internal protocols and policies, are in place to best serve applicants in a way that is transparent and accountable to the public. The review will draw upon expertise in all facets of zoning to review best practices in the field, and inform any opportunities moving forward for how to institute even stronger operational controls and accountability at the ZBA.\"Boston is a city that is booming with economic development, from new companies moving to our city and the creation of housing being at an all-time high-record,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"The pace of our growth is unparalleled to any other time in our city\\'s history, which is a tremendous economic boon for our city, but also brings its own set of challenges. Through this review, I want to make sure that our agencies and staff are best equipped with the knowledge, tools and training they need to do their jobs effectively and to the standard of which they are held.\"Mayor Walsh has asked Sullivan & Worcester LLP to conduct this comprehensive review beginning with the rules and regulations in place that dictate how the ZBA conducts business on behalf of the residents of Boston, and those with matters before the board.\"Since taking office, my Administration has worked to level the playing field in the development process in Boston, emphasizing transparency and ensuring broader access and input from the community,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I recognize that there is always more work to be done to make the business of city government more accessible and transparent to everyone. I am hopeful that we will learn from the findings of this review how else we can better serve our constituencies and implement best practices used in the field.\"Since taking office in 2014, bringing transparency to every corner of City government has been a pillar of the Walsh Administration. In 2016, after hearing important feedback from the Boston community over the course of two years about the direction of Boston\\'s planning agency, Mayor Walsh launched an effort to overhaul the former Boston Redevelopment Authority\\'s identity.\\xa0 With the intent of better serving the people of Boston and inspiring greater trust and confidence in the city\\'s planning agency, the now Boston Planning & Development Agency reflects the Walsh Administration\\'s commitment to smart and sound urban planning and positive economic development.Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh signed into law a municipal lobbying ordinance that requires lobbyists, lobbyist entities and lobbying clients to register with the Boston City Clerk, and file disclosure statements four times each calendar year. This ordinance brought transparency and accountability to municipal lobbying for the first time in Boston. Before this ordinance was signed into law, lobbyists were only required to register at the state level.About the ZBA:The ZBA is a seven-member entity that is charged with reviewing any development proposal that requires zoning relief.

For the first time, general operating grants will only go to organizations with annual budgets under $2 million. We will also now award grants in established amounts, dependent upon organizational budget. Organizations within the same budget range will receive the same amount of funding.\\xa0The BCC will award up to five grants this year to organizations with budgets of $1-2 million, specifically focusing on those that uniquely serve the City’s arts ecosystem and prioritize cultural diversity, economic diversity, inclusion, and equity, through both their staffing and audiences served. We will no longer be awarding project grants.\\xa0How did this change come about? Over the last year we developed a working equity statement and piloted a Model Equity Organization designation to honor organizations that exemplify the goals and values of that equity statement. We then took a close look at our grant guidelines in the broader context of arts funding in Boston, which led us to conclude the best way to serve the ecosystem is to focus on small and mid-sized organizations.\\xa0Over 70% of the arts and culture organizations in Boston have budgets of less than $250,000, and small and mid-sized organizations make up over 85% of arts organizations in our ecosystem. Despite the high number of small and mid-sized organizations in the city, a 2016 study by The Boston Foundation found that \"Boston\\'s small and mid-sized arts organizations do not receive significant Foundation support. Foundation giving appears to be skewed toward larger organizations.\" The same study found that the lack of foundation support puts more stress on small and mid-sized organizations to raise funds through individuals and earned revenue like ticket sales, which drives more risk-averse programming decisions.\\xa0In addition, although they receive comparatively less support than larger organizations, small to mid-sized organizations are often focused on cultural equity work. The same study found that cultural equity is a priority for Boston’s arts organizations, and that “small and mid-sized organizations in particular expressed commitment to addressing issues of social justice, equality, and diversity through their work.” For these reasons, the Boston Cultural Council has decided to focus on small and mid-sized organizations, because we believe these City grant funds can provide a critical service: supporting an equitable arts ecosystem.\\xa0As part of this transition, we aim to better understand the small and mid-sized organizations in Boston and how they can be supported. How do we help organizations grow so that they can take advantage of other funding opportunities? What kinds of capacity building and services can the City provide to help organizations achieve sustainability? At the same time, we are in touch with large organizations who have received grants from us in the past to learn more about how we may offer non-monetary support, and we’ve already generated some interesting ideas. We’re excited to continue this multi-year journey to learn about and better support the arts in Boston, and we thank you for your contributions to the City of Boston’s dynamic and diverse arts sector.The 2020 grant application closes on October 15. Learn more about our funding strategy and grant guidelines by visiting the Boston Cultural Council website.', 'Mayor Martin J. Walsh and the Mayor’s Office of Arts and Culture today announced the 2020 applications for Boston Cultural Council Organizational Grants and the Opportunity Fund are now open. Building on Mayor Walsh’s commitment to expanding and supporting arts in Boston, this year’s round of funding marks the largest ever with more than $800,000 available to artists and arts organizations.“In the City of Boston, we recognize the importance of investing in the arts, and the profound impact creative expression can have on public safety, community engagement, and overall well-being,” said Mayor Walsh. “It’s exciting to be able to support the incredible talent and hard work of Boston’s local artists and arts organizations in this way, and I look forward to seeing every neighborhood benefit from these programs.”The Boston Cultural Council (BCC) works under the umbrella of the Mayor’s Office of Arts and Culture to annually distribute funds allocated by the City of Boston and the Mass Cultural Council for local arts and culture programming, and next year it will award general operating grants only to organizations with annual budgets under $2 million.Under a revised grant making approach, organizations may apply for grants up to a set limit, based on their organizational size. If an organization is selected as a recipient, they will receive a grant in one of the following categories:The BCC will award up to five grants this year to organizations with budgets of $1-2 million, specifically focusing on those that uniquely serve the City’s arts ecosystem and prioritize cultural diversity, economic diversity, inclusion, and equity, through both their staffing and audiences served.\\xa0These changes reflect years of discussion about how to deepen the impact of the BCC’s grantmaking, and how to make it more equitable and inclusive.

Council members are selected on the basis of their demonstrated commitment to Boston’s cultural community and their knowledge of various arts disciplines.\\xa0In 2019, the BCC awarded 221 grants totaling $487,000 to 221 Boston arts organizations, making it the most amount of funding ever distributed through this program. The BCC also established an equity statement last year, and for the first time ever awarded an additional Model Equity Organization award of $5,000 each to three organizations, BAMS Fest, Arts Connect International, and Urbano Project.The Opportunity Fund was launched in August 2016 with the goal of supporting individual artists in activities that help them share their work with the public, teach others, continue their professional development and hone their skills. The amount of funding allocated to this program doubled last year to $200,000, and the same amount has been allocated for fiscal year 2020.The Opportunity Fund reopened with a modified structure including grants that are separated into three categories: Artist Career Development, Local Arts Experiences & Events, and a matching MCC Festivals Grant. Artists applying for Local Arts Experiences & Events grants can apply for up to $2,000, while artists applying for Artist Career Development and Matching MCC Festivals Grants can apply for up to $1,000.Including support for more than 220 arts organizations, Mayor Walsh has dedicated over $2.5 million in funding in the past year toward arts programming, by investing in more than 200 individual artists, and 90+ free arts experiences for all residents to enjoy. Over the next five years, the City is also committing $13.4 million to the Percent for Art program. This, combined with $80,000 for temporary public art projects in the next year and several new City staff positions, is the most funding the City has ever dedicated to Boston’s arts sector.\\xa0The deadline to apply for a Boston Cultural Council grant is October 15 and the deadline to apply for the first round of the Opportunity Fund is September 30, 2019.\\xa0', 'BOSTON - Tuesday, September 3, 2019 - In recognition of National Preparedness Month, which began on September 1, Mayor Martin J.

August 29, 2019 - Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced the City of Boston has agreed to a settlement agreement with Airbnb, establishing Airbnb\\'s responsibilities under the City of Boston\\'s short-term rental ordinance. Under this agreement, Airbnb will help facilitate the widespread adoption of Boston\\'s short-term rental registration system, and will remove listings for illegal short-term rentals from its website. This settlement agreement furthers Mayor Walsh\\'s work to create and preserve affordable housing in Boston, prioritizing affordable homes for all residents.\\xa0\"My goal in regulating short-term rentals has always been to responsibly incorporate the growth of the home-share industry into our work to create affordable housing for all by striking a fair balance between preserving housing and allowing Bostonians to benefit from this new industry,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I\\'m pleased we were able to reach a settlement with Airbnb, and continue our important work ensuring that Boston remains a home for all residents.\"\\xa0Under the terms of the agreement, Boston will continue to require owners to register their units, and continue the City\\'s regulations about which units are eligible to be used as short-term rentals. On September 1, 2019, Airbnb\\'s website will add a function to allow hosts to enter and display their required City-formatted registration number. By December 1, 2019, all listings will be required to display a City-formatted registration number, or the listings will be removed. Airbnb will inform users of the City\\'s short-term rental standards, and work with users\\xa0 to ensure their listings are registered with the City of Boston.In addition, Airbnb will also share key data with the City of Boston, including the listing\\'s unique ID/URL, submitted registration number, unique host ID, listing information, and listing zip code.\\xa0Finally, under the settlement agreement, the City of Boston will have the power to notify Airbnb of any listing the City believes is ineligible under Boston\\'s short-term rental ordinance. Unless the host complies with Boston\\'s short-term rental registration process in thirty days, Airbnb will remove the listing from its platform.\\xa0The City of Boston\\'s short-term rental regulations allow for the growth of Boston\\'s home-sharing industry, while including deterrents to prevent operators from monopolizing Boston\\'s housing market with short-term rentals. In addition, the regulations provide a standardized framework for regulating these units that meets the needs of the evolving industry, provides protections for occupants, and minimizes the impact on surrounding neighbors of these units. These regulations only apply to property owners registered with the City to operate a short-term rental in their unit. Non-owner occupants are not permitted to operate short-term rentals in their leased units.The ordinance\\xa0will continue to take a three-tiered approach to classifying short-term rental units:\\xa0Limited Share Unit: consists of a private bedroom or shared space in the owner-operator\\'s primary residence, in which the operator is present during the rental. The fee associated with this classification is $25 per year.Home Share Unit: consists of a whole unit available for a short-term rental at the primary residence of the owner-operator (unit in which operator resides for at least nine months out of a 12 month period). The fee associated with this classification is $200 per year.Owner-Adjacent Unit: consists of an owner-occupied two- or three-family building, in which the owner lists a single secondary unit as a short-term rental. The fee associated with this classification is $200 per year.The regulations also provide protections for the occupants of the short-term rental unit by prohibiting any property with outstanding housing, sanitary, building, fire or zoning code violations from being listed. In addition, the operator is required to provide notice to abutters of a short-term rental unit within 30 days of approved registration.The regulations require the unit to register with the City of Boston each year to verify compliance with the provisions of the ordinance, and pay an annual license fee. Penalties will be incurred by any person who offers an ineligible unit as a short-term rental, fails to register their eligible unit before offering the unit as a short-term rental, or fails to comply with a notice of violation.To date, the Walsh Administration has committed more than $100 million in funding to the creation and preservation of affordable housing. Mayor Walsh\\'s short-term rental policy and this enforcement agreement build on the City\\'s preservation and anti-displacement goals, outlined in\\xa0Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030, Mayor Walsh\\'s housing plan, and the housing goals laid out in\\xa0Imagine Boston 2030, Boston\\'s first citywide plan in 50 years. As part of both plans, Boston has prioritized increasing the overall housing supply, with a focus on creating and preserving affordable housing. In addition, a new source of funding for affordable housing, historic preservation, open space and public recreation was established through passage of the Community Preservation Act in November 2016.This agreement will add on the City\\'s overall housing goal of creating 69,000 new units by 2030, to meet Boston\\'s faster than expected population growth. These 69,000 units include 15,820 income-restricted units, which would elevate Boston\\'s income-restricted inventory total to 70,000, or one in five of all housing units. In addition, the plan set a goal to preserve 85 percent of Boston\\'s most at-risk privately-owned affordable units, and to purchase 1,000 units of rental housing stock from the speculative market and income-restrict them for perpetuity.\\xa0Mayor Walsh\\'s 2019\\xa0housing security legislative package\\xa0has continued Boston\\'s focus on expanding upon the work the City has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis and displacement risks for tenants. The housing security bills proposed seek to help existing tenants, particularly older adults, remain in their homes, and creates additional funding for affordable housing.Data shows that the availability of short-term rental units has a direct correlation to housing costs. A\\xa02016 study\\xa0by UMass Boston found a 0.4 percent increase in rent prices due to increases in AirBNB listings, and a nationwide UCLA study also found a 0.42 percent increase.###', 'BOSTON - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - In an effort to streamline the move-in process, Mayor Martin J.

I look forward to continuing to serve the people of our beautiful City in this new capacity. I thank Mayor Walsh for this opportunity.”Born in Cabo Verde, Carvalho emigrated to Dorchester at the age of 15. A graduate of Boston Public Schools, Carvalho graduated at the top of his class at Madison Park High, and went to earn degrees from UMass Amherst and Howard University School of Law.\\xa0\\nCarvalho began his legal career doing high level internal investigations of large companies and complex litigations at the law firm WilmerHale.

When municipalities voted to enact CPA, they did so with the promise of a substantial state match. This year, the match was just 11 percent with a one-time surplus allotment added, but the CPA bill people voted for is no longer the same bill.

This fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017. The City uses this revenue to fund initiatives consistent with statewide CPA guidelines: affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and public recreation.

Walsh today joined Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation, Windale Developers, Harvard University, elected officials and residents to celebrate the completion of the first phase of the Bartlett Station development, which will transform a vacant lot into a new mixed-use, transit-oriented development. The two buildings that were celebrated with a ribbon cutting today will offer 76 new homes, five units for homeless individuals and 13,300 square feet of community-oriented retail storefronts on a once-vacant MBTA property in Roxbury.\\xa0\\xa0“Affordable housing is the key to opportunity for families and helps give our residents a good quality of life,” said Mayor Walsh. “At a time when the federal government is stepping back from investments in affordable housing, Boston and our partners are stepping up. I\\'m proud of the work that the City, Nuestra Communidad, Windale and all our partners have done to create these new homes and jobs that will continue to keep this a strong, vibrant place to live and work.\"Today’s ribbon cutting represents the culmination of more than a decade of planning, advocacy and hard work by the community to restore an approximately 8-acre former brownfield site in Roxbury. Bartlett Station is a multiphase project which proposes approximately\\xa0 383 new homes for working families, including 166 homes for purchase, 217 apartments and 30,000 square feet of commercial space upon completion. The development project is anticipated to generate approximately 100 retail jobs and 900 construction jobs, with 60 percent of the jobs going to workers of color.The first two buildings of Bartlett Station celebrated today consist of a 60-unit mixed-income rental apartment building and a 16-unit new condominium building. The apartment building boasts 23 one-bedroom apartments, 30 two-bedroom apartments, and 7 three-bedroom apartments. Two-thirds of the new housing is affordable to workforce individuals and families, including 32 units deemed as affordable to families earning less than 60 percent of Area Median Income (AMI).\\xa0“As a life-long Bostonian, I am truly grateful for the impact Bartlett Station has on our city. This project helps to alleviate the affordability tension in our housing market by creating truly affordable homes for people who may not have had the opportunity to live in Boston,” said State Representative Chynah Tyler. “We are committed to working to create and preserve even more affordable housing for all of our families to live comfortably. This is why I am pleased to support Mayor Walsh, the City of Boston, Nuestra CDC, Harvard, and all the partners in making Boston affordable for everyone.”“I was thrilled to celebrate the opening of Bartlett Station, which is providing much needed mixed income housing, including two-thirds affordable and workforce units in Roxbury,” said Boston City Councilor Kim Janey, who represents the neighborhood. “I want to thank the Mayor and all of the partners that helped us get here, especially Nuestra Communidad, Windale, and all of the residents who have been engaged in this process over the years. Today was a good day!”“I am proud that Bartlett Station is a transformative, equitable development that is part of our anti displacement strategy for Dudley Square,” said Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation Executive Director David Price. “I want to thank all of our many partners for helping to realize our vision to turn a contaminated brownfield eyesore into a new development that has real economic and health benefits for our community.”\\xa0\\xa0“Bartlett Station’s unique mixed-income program was designed for working people like me. My family doesn’t qualify as low income, but at Bartlett Station I qualified for the middle group,” said Joani Torres who lives in the new apartment building. “I love that everything is where I need it. The bus stop right in front of our building can take my daughter to school each day, and drop her off at our front door. We’re closer to family and my job, and I can just walk to work each day. I want to thank the Mayor and Nuestra Comunidad for making this possible. We’re proud to call this beautiful affordable building our home.”In addition to new housing, the apartment building has two retail storefronts located along Washington Street. Good Food Markets, slated to open later this year, plans to provide healthy food, hire people from the community, offer job training and career opportunities, and promote healthy food choices to people in Roxbury. Good Food Markets is a nonprofit grocery store dedicated to addressing issues of food access and community health by working in partnership with Nuestra Comunidad, Boston Medical Center, and the Kresge Foundation.\\xa0“Good Food Markets is proud to join the Roxbury community,” said Philip Sambol, executive director of Good Food Markets. “Good Food Markets is a collaborative effort in the community that transcends food access. The residents and community leaders that we have met over the last three years care about what we care about: a store that is by, of, and for the Roxbury community. Good Food Markets is a retail platform, but the real success is achieved by listening and taking action with our neighbors.”\\xa0Secured by the Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA), the project was made possible in part by $1 million in linkage funds, a payment from large commercial developments for the creation of housing and job training programs, and $1 million in Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) funds. IDP requires that market-rate housing developments with 10 or more units and need zoning relief contribute to income-restricted housing.\\xa0Harvard University contributed more than $600,000 in pre-development financing to help develop Bartlett Station. Harvard’s initiative, formerly known as 20/20/2000, was first launched in 2000 and committed $20 million in low-interest, flexible loans. It has helped leverage more than $1.3 billion in housing developments with more than 5,500 affordable units in Boston and more than 1,600 affordable units in Cambridge. Harvard University recently announced it would recommit $20 million to an initiative aimed at increasing the amount of affordable housing in Greater Boston.\\xa0“Harvard is pleased to renew the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative. We are proud to be part of a community where partners from across Greater Boston come together to strengthen the region and address the urgent need for quality, affordable housing,” said Harvard President Larry Bacow. “We are grateful to Mayor Walsh, Chief Dillon and all of our partners for their support and their efforts to increase access to homeownership and promote fair and equitable access to housing.”The developers of Bartlett Station have deep roots in the Roxbury community. Nuestra Comunidad has a 38-year legacy of creating communities of opportunity, building new community assets, and transforming community through economic development. Nuestra Comunidad has built more than 800 affordable apartments for working families, and built and sold nearly 200 homes that have created wealth and neighborhood stability for Roxbury residents.

The bakery’s irresistible menu, impeccable design, and welcoming atmosphere are reflections of the hard work and vision of founder and CEO Tzurit Or. Or left Israel and came to the United States in 2003 for what she thought would be a couple of years of new experiences, and now 16 years later, she and Tatte are here to stay.\\xa0When Or immigrated to the U.S. in 2003, she felt like an outsider. Her English was shaky, and she did not feel as though she had a community where she fit in\\xa0 comfortably. She missed feeling connected to people, to her home, and to the good food she was accustomed to both creating and eating in Israel. Or took matters into her own hands, literally, and began baking her favorite pastries to sell at a Copley Square farmer’s market. Not only did Bostonians enjoy her pastries and her food, but they couldn't get enough, and after only one summer she opened up her first Tatte location in Brookline in 2008.\\xa0Opening the first Tatte bakery was no easy task. Or faced the challenges of a language barrier, securing a loan, and the inherent loneliness that came with having no family or friends around to offer help or support. However, her persistence has proven worthwhile and says, “there is a magic in Tatte which gives me a home and hopefully makes other immigrants feel like they are at home too.” She adds, “Our customers are often emotionally connected to the space [and the food], and each person has their own favorite location...It provides people with a sense of belonging.”\\xa0Through creating her own home away from home, Or has bolstered communities where everyone can feel comfortable, and this is part of what gives Tatte its widespread appeal.\\xa0Or has a few words of advice for other entrepreneurs looking to start their own businesses. She urges them to build their knowledge about how businesses function and have a diligent vision. She recalls, “my first five or seven years with Tatte I did everything. I baked, I did the payroll, I did everything. Make sure you know how to run a business on your own.”\\xa0In addition to being the owner, Or is also the interior designer for each location. “I sketch every Tatte by hand from everything you see with the flow of customers, to where you are sitting now,” she says. Or feels as though her involvement in the design of the bakeries allows her to create a welcoming atmosphere, down to every last detail. Or encourages fellow entrepreneurs to seek this level of attention to detail in developing their own businesses.\\xa0Or’s dedication to serving her growing customer base, and sharing her home away from home with them is undeniable. As a woman immigrant, she has been faced with many obstacles and challenges simply due to her identity.\\xa0 Or says “I am surrounded by men, but we have a lot of women in the company because women get things done. In my leadership team I believe it is equal with men and women, maybe more women than men actually[...]. I’m sure I’ve experienced more discrimination than I realize, but I do not let it bother me, I focus on what matters.”\\xa0Tzurit Or is an extraordinary woman and entrepreneur, and her hunger to succeed and provide welcoming communities throughout the city in Tatte is marked by a fierce determination to not let any obstacle hinder her vision.\\xa0\", \"On August 15, 1870, Boston’s Board of Aldermen paid James Doherty a reward for information leading to the capture of Nellie Burn’s kidnapper. The order as well as other documentation of Nellie's kidnapping were filed in Board of Aldermen's dockets, and eventually came to live at the Boston City Archives.Nellie Burns was kidnapped in April of 1870. Shortly after she disappeared, her family received the below ransom note. It demanded that $200 in unmarked bills be sent immediately to the kidnappers. The note warned that counterfeit or marked bills “would not be received” and that it would be no use to arrest the person who came to collect the money “as they will know nothing about it.” The note also demanded that more money be paid after Nellie was released.\\xa0Boston's Police Department offered a $500 reward leading for information that lead to Nellie's safe return.\\xa0We’re not sure how Nellie was found or how exactly her kidnapper was captured, but we do know that in May of 1870, a woman named Elizabeth Chase was sentence to six years in the House of Correction for Nellie's kidnapping. We also know that\\xa0on August 15, 1870, James Doherty collected a $500 reward for information leading to her kidnapper’s arrest.\\xa0These records offer a glimpse into a larger story.

Walsh today joined the Fenway Community Development Corporation, their development partner Schochet Companies and Lower Roxbury residents to celebrate the acquisition and preservation of 97 affordable housing units at the Newcastle/Saranac Apartments.\\xa0\\xa0\"Preserving Boston\\'s affordability is key to ensuring everyone who wants to live here can afford to do so, and I\\'m particularly pleased our commitment to the Newcastle/Saranac Apartments will both preserve and renovate 97 units of our existing affordable housing stock,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"I want to thank the Fenway CDC and our partners for working with us to make sure families can stay in their homes. Together, we’re protecting long-time residents from displacement, and we’re helping maintain the character of this community.\"The preservation of the units is made possible through Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) off-site unit contributions by three housing development projects: 60 Kilmarnock Street, 1000 Boylston Street, and 212 Stuart Street, negotiated by the Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA). IDP requires that market-rate housing developments with 10 or more units and need zoning relief contribute to income-restricted housing.\\xa0“Newcastle/Saranac has been my home for years, I raised my family here and I love this neighborhood,” said Patricia Rogers, a 30-year resident of Newcastle/Saranac Apartments. “This building is in at a convenient location, but the best part of living here is my neighbors. We look out for each other. I want to thank the Mayor, Fenway CDC and all of the people here today for helping us stay in our homes.”The City’s Department of Neighborhood Development (DND) worked with the Fenway CDC to acquire the building and assist in the plan for the renovation of its 97 apartments, located on Columbus Avenue and Northampton Street in Lower Roxbury. Newcastle Saranac\\'s long-term affordability restrictions were set to expire as the former owners paid off the mortgage they\\'d received using the MassHousing 13A program. If the building converted to market-rate, all of the tenants were likely to be displaced from homes they had lived in for decades. With help from City of Boston, Fenway CDC was able to purchase the building from its owners, protecting existing tenants from displacement, and preserving the long-term affordability of this mixed-income development.“You know the old saying ‘It takes a village?’ Well, in order to save 97 units of affordable housing at Newcastle/Saranac, it took the City of Boston, the Commonwealth, and numerous quasi-public entities, banks and investors to rescue these apartments,” said Leah Camhi, executive director of the Fenway CDC. “The families at Newcastle/Saranac are now guaranteed affordable homes for years to come due to all their herculean efforts.”\\xa0The Newcastle/Saranac acquisition and preservation was made possible with the significant support from the City’s Department of Neighborhood Development, the Boston Planning & Development Agency, the State’s Department of Housing and Community Development, MassDevelopment, MassHousing, Massachusetts Housing Investment Corp and the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation.\\xa0Today\\'s celebration builds on the release of Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030, Boston\\'s latest quarterly housing report, and the City\\'s overall housing goal of 69,000 new units by 2030, to meet Boston\\'s faster than expected population growth.

Worried but determined, Minh was looking to find a solution for her family. Her son was in programs that supported his disability, but her daughter was not. Her son was able to get picked up and dropped off at their home using the Boston Public Schools (BPS) door-to-door program. But Minh’s daughter did not qualify for this program and would need to use a different bus stop. This posed a serious problem for Minh, who could not be in both places at the same time.When Minh arrived at the school, it was difficult to communicate her problem. Minh is comfortable using basic phrases in English, but primarily speaks Vietnamese. When she tried to express her situation in English it became difficult. School Principal Joanna McKeigue Cruz wanted to help, and this required an interpreter.In East Boston, Spanish is the top spoken language after English. The Samuel Adams School had other resources ready and staff who speak Spanish. But, options were very limited for other languages. BPS schools were dependent on in-person interpretation for each language service request. This was the case regardless of the amount of interpretation needed. And, it could take up to two weeks to get in-person support. This was discouraging for families who would otherwise receive immediate help.Fortunately, a telephonic interpretation service became available earlier that day. This on-demand service makes timely interpretation possible in 350 languages. It is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Interpreters are also available who are familiar with special education laws and policies. Currently, 93% of BPS’s translation and interpretation requests involve special education. The BPS Office of English Learners (OEL) made this service possible.Principal McKeigue Cruz hoped this could help her understand Minh’s situation. She dialed the service for the first time in real-time. She was able to connect with a Vietnamese interpreter, on the special education line. The matched interpreter was already familiar with Minh’s son’s needs and options. Within minutes, Minh and McKeigue Cruz were able to understand each other and find a solution. Minh also took the opportunity to ask about at-home ABA services. She felt that these were essential to her son’s growth. Her son received more ABA services as a result. Both were thrilled to be able to work together without language or time obstacles.In-person interpreting is often still the most valuable type of interpretation. It is the best for long, complex or technical conversations and planned events. But, the amount of time and human resources needed for it are big barriers. The telephonic service is more efficent for information sharing between families and staff. This supports families who often need more support. It also helps parents rely less on their children to interpret. Reflecting on that day a year ago, Principal McKeigue Cruz says that, “all families feel they are able to communicate with us and are included.\"The Samuel Adams School is not the only one to use the service. It is not the only school in Boston that needs to. 31% of BPS District students identify as English Learners (EL). 21% of total students enrolled in BPS have a disability. There are at least 72 different languages spoken at home by EL students. During the 2018-2019 school year, 21,592 minutes (360 hours) were logged on the service. That’s one and a half hours every business day over the past 12 months.U.S. public schools are legally mandated to communicate information to parents in a language that they understand. This includes any program, service, or activity available to parents who speak English. The OEL’s Translation and Interpretation Unit (T&I Unit) is key in meeting this mandate. They work to find new ways that BPS can increase language and communications access. The T&I Unit oversees translation and interpretation services for the District. They also translate information into the nine major languages of the District. Translation of other languages is available upon request.Priya Tahiliani, Assistant Superintendent for the Office of English Learners, thanks the Mayor’s Office for their support. Funding has increased and together they have created shared expectations for this work. This collaboration prioritizes services that did not always get the attention they needed. This is important for a city where 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant. City services like BOS 311, the Mayor’s hotline, have been using a similar telephonic interpretation service since 2017. Together, they are improving language and communications access for city residents.One of the most ways to be successful, according to Allen Dowling, T&I Unit Director, is parent awareness. OEL has made a large effort to keep parents informed. Every school main office has a kit of translated brochures and posters about parent rights and available resources. They are also available on the BPS website.The T&I Unit handles interpreter training, as well as takes in constant feedback from parents. This year, they hope to launch an official survey for parents about their services. T&I trains interpreters for special education meetings, legal and ethical factors, modes of interpreting, and the role. They also go over the Individualized Education Program (IEP) and student support services. This ensures that families receive high quality and consistent services.So what is coming next? Parents can lookout for American Sign Language (ASL) Video Remote Interpretation (VRI). The Deaf or those hard of hearing who use ASL will be able to use VRI. T&I also plans to improve its system of record (Aspen SIS) to send report cards, progress reports and conduct letters in the nine primary languages.*Minh’s name was changed.The City of Boston Office of Language and Communication Access works to strengthen city services, programs and activities to be meaningfully accessible to all residents.

The building earned the distinction of being LEED-Homes “Silver” certified by the U.S. Green Building Council. The development also met the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star standards.\\xa0\\xa0Paris Village has been made possible because of funding from the City of Boston, in part from funds secured by the Boston Planning & Development Agency from private, market rate developments (the Inclusionary Development Policy Fund and the Neighborhood Housing Trust/Linkage Funds), as well as funds from the State’s Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), and construction and permanent loans from Citizens Bank.\\xa0Today's grand opening builds on the release of Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030, Boston’s latest quarterly housing report, and the City's overall housing goal of 69,000 new units by 2030, to meet Boston's faster than expected population growth.

H.R. 8 would close serious loopholes in the nation\\'s background check system for gun purchases, and H.R. 1112 would lengthen the background check review period deadline. The bills have been awaiting Senate action for nearly six months.\\xa0Under the leadership of Mayor Walsh and\\xa0 Boston Police Commissioner Commissioner William Gross, the City of Boston and the Boston Police Department are working every day to build and strengthen relationships with the community, in partnership with many other agencies, non-profits, and community based programs. Just this month, Mayor Walsh and Commissioner Gross led Boston\\'s National Night Out, community events that celebrate positive relationships between community members and the local police officers who serve them.Mayor Walsh has made gun violence reduction and combating illegal gun trafficking a public safety priority, through developing and implementing a holistic approach that engages with partners at the federal, state, local and community levels. In 2019, the Boston Police Department has so far removed 459 guns off Boston streets.The full text of the letter is below and can be found\\xa0here.\\xa0###August 8, 2019\\xa0The Honorable Mitch McConnellMajority LeaderUnited States SenateWashington, DC 20510\\xa0The Honorable Charles E. SchumerDemocratic LeaderUnited States SenateWashington, DC 201510Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer:RE: Senate Action Needed NOW on Gun Safety LegislationOn behalf of The United States Conference of Mayors, we urge you to immediately call the Senate back to Washington to take action on bipartisan gun safety legislation.Already in 2019, there have been over 250 mass shootings. The tragic events in El Paso and Dayton this weekend are just the latest reminders that our nation can no longer wait for our federal government to take the actions necessary to prevent people who should not have access to firearms from being able to purchase them.In late February, the House of Representatives passed two bills that would greatly strengthen the background check system:H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act of 2019H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019H.R. 8 passed the House on February 27 on a bipartisan vote of 240-190. It would close serious loopholes in the background check system by:requiring all firearm purchases to undergo a NICS background checkhelping to prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining deadly weapons by circumventing the laws on the booksprohibiting unlicensed transfers of guns through unregulated secondary sales andincreasing law enforcement\\'s ability to trace crime guns.H.R. 1112 passed the House on February 28 on a bipartisan vote of 228-198. If this bill had been law in 2015, the terrible tragedy that occurred at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston might have been avoided. The bill would extend the background check review period deadline from three to 10 business days, to help ensure that background checks are completed before weapons are sold and that dangerous individuals who should not have them are unable to purchase them.H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are bipartisan, sensible gun safety bills that would make our cities and our people safer, and would in no way compromise gun owners\\' rights.We urge you to call the Senate back to session now to take up and pass these bills to help reduce gun violence and the terrible toll it takes in our cities and our nation.Quick passage of these bills is a critical step to reducing gun violence in our country. The United States Conference of Mayors stands ready to work with Congress, the Administration and others to develop holistic remedies to the scourge of gun violence. America has proven time and again that we can rise to our most difficult challenges. We look forward to working with you to find a way forward to protect our citizens from this senseless carnage.', \"The Boston Parks and Recreation Department (BPRD), in partnership with the Friends of the Public Garden (the Friends), is collecting public input about the future of the Boston Common through an expansive public engagement process: on the Common, around the City, at open houses/public meetings, and via an\\xa0online survey.As America’s first public park, Boston Common is one of the most treasured greenspaces in the world. The overarching goal of the new Master Plan is to create a Common that will serve all people of Boston and visitors while protecting this special place for decades to come.BPRD and the Friends are hosting a series of Park Presence Days on the Common and around the City. A movable kiosk - playfully dubbed the ‘Mini Common’ - will allow the public to learn more about the master planning effort, provide feedback on the park today, and share ideas for the future. The first round of public outreach will be conducted:Park Presence Day @ the African Festival on Boston CommonMini Common @ Maverick T Station in East BostonMini Common @ Open Newbury on Newbury Street in Back BayPark Presence Day @ Frog Pond Movie Night, Boston CommonMini Common @ Chinatown Main Street Lantern Festival, Chinatown Gate at the GreenwayMini-Common @ Mission Hill Farmer’s Market, Roxbury CrossingPark Presence Day @ Brewer Fountain, Boston CommonFor more information about the survey, Mini Common events, and open houses planned for the upcoming months, please visit the Boston Common Master plan website. Residents and park users are encouraged to take the Boston Common Master Plan survey. The survey will remain active through December 31, 2019.“Boston Common has always been a park by and for the people of our city,” said Boston Parks Commissioner Ryan Woods.\\xa0 “Thanks to the $28 million Mayor Martin J. Walsh committed from the sale of the City’s Winthrop Square garage, we are now able to augment the current historic levels of funding to fully renovate America's first public park while preserving its rich heritage. We now look forward to the input of residents, business people, institutions, and park users to help shape this master plan as we map out the future of this historic meeting ground in the heart of Boston.”\\xa0\\xa0Led by Weston & Sampson, the consultant team has been studying the park and meeting with stakeholder groups since April 2019. The Boston Common Master Plan includes the development of a set of principles, goals and objectives to guide the work an inventory of the park’s existing conditions and resources an assessment of current and future park needs and the public engagement process that is underway. The final plan will define a strong, clear vision that will celebrate the history of place and craft a comprehensive revitalization strategy for this legacy public open space asset.“This outreach process is designed to make sure that the Boston Common truly lives up to its reputation as ‘the people’s park’ – accessible and welcoming to all, supporting a wide variety of uses that reflect the needs of the community\\xa0 today and into the future,” said Liz Vizza, Executive Director of the Friends of the Public Garden. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a bold plan that ensures this iconic public green space continues to thrive and fulfills the needs of the millions of people who enjoy it every year.”We create and maintain clean, green, safe, and accessible public park land and open space throughout Boston.

Where do they sail along? If we knew more about how buses travel across the City, could we make bus service better for everyone?The City of Boston does not have direct control over the bus system in the greater Boston area. The bus system is run by the MBTA, a state agency. But, the City does have control over the roads and intersections throughout Boston. We need to make sure that roads and intersections are designed in a way that keeps buses moving along their routes.As part of that effort, the Boston Transportation Department wanted to know where buses were running into trouble. This summer, I was able to use GPS data published by the MBTA to create a heatmap visualization of bus delays. This interactive map will help the Transportation Department find and redesign the intersections that are slowing buses down.While building the visualization for the heatmap, I ran into a few interesting problems.Every MBTA bus is fitted with a GPS tracker. The MBTA provides an API that you can use to find the location of any bus in real time. Unfortunately, you cannot use the API to find out anything about speed. So how can we determine where buses are getting held up using only data about their location? I decided not to visualize speed at all. Instead, what my visualization shows is where buses are most likely to be found at any given time.It might not be immediately obvious why this is a workable substitute for speed. But imagine a bus traveling back and forth along Route 1, which stretches from Harvard Square in Cambridge to Dudley Square in Roxbury. Perhaps it travels slowly along Mass. Ave., where there is lots of traffic, but quickly across the Harvard Bridge over the Charles River. If you had a pencil and a map of Boston, and every five minutes you noted the location of that bus by drawing a little dot on the map, after a day or two you would start to notice that Mass. Ave. has accumulated a higher density of dots than Harvard Bridge. The bus travels more slowly along Mass. Ave., so it spends more time there, and you’ll find it there more often.This is how my visualization works. I\\'ve built an automated data pipeline that pulls in GPS data from the MBTA\\'s API every five minutes. I then use that data to show which streets have accumulated a high density of dots.I wanted the \"high density\" congested streets to be an angry red color in my visualization. But I realized that I had no clear definition of \"high density.\"I was tempted to use an absolute cutoff. For example, I thought about making every street where buses had appeared more than a certain number of times a \"high density\" street. The problem with that approach, though, was that it would make the busier bus routes — the ones simply running more buses — look more congested than the less busy bus routes. What I really wanted to visualize instead was where each bus route was congested relative to the rest of the same bus route.In the end, I chose to color each street based on how much of an \"outlier\" it is, in terms of bus appearances or dots, when compared to the mean across all streets in a bus route. The red streets in my completed visualization are streets that are well above the mean for the bus route. In fact, they are in the top 20 percent of \"bad\" streets across the City. My summer fellowship with the Analytics Team has only been eight weeks long, but in that time I\\'ve learned so many new things. I\\'ve developed new technical skills. Before working on this bus route project, I had never used PostGIS, a tool that allows you to express geospatial concepts in your database queries. Now I know more about complex PostGIS queries than I could ever want to know. I\\'ve also learned a lot about how Boston City government works and how departments at the City collaborate to improve the lives of Boston residents.If you are thinking about becoming a summer fellow, I encourage you to apply! You\\'ll have an opportunity to learn from some wicked smart data engineers and analysts, of course. But, you\\'ll also have an opportunity to talk to City employees throughout City Hall. The fellowship gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how municipal problem-solving happens here every day.This blog post was written by Sinclair Target, a 2019 summer fellow on the Analytics Team.

With Liza Quiñonez, Marka27 is a co-founder of Street Theory, a Creative Studio and Gallery. They both have more than 15 years of experience in education, nonprofit and arts programming. Marka27 conducts workshops and lectures on participatory artmaking and was the keynote speaker for the 2014 graduating class of the Parsons Scholars Program at Parsons School of Design in NYC, utilizing his life, art and work experiences to inspire disadvantaged youth, immigrants, and first generation college students to pursue artistic endeavors. He was also commissioned by the City of Boston in 2017 to create the mural \"Love Thyself\" as part of the Grove Hall mural series.\\xa0Brian Beyung with the Chinese Historical Society of New Englandreceived $10,000 to create a mural in Chinatown. Beyung was born in Montreal, to a Chinese-Cambodian refugee family. Trained in graphic design, Beyung is aware of the infinite possibilities that digital technology has to offer. He paints everyday life subjects with a pronounced taste for geometric shapes and graphic design composition. Between figurative and abstract art, he creates dynamic compositions where he deconstructs forms to give a second approach to an image, an idea, or a memory. Over the past five years, he has completed murals and installations in his hometown of Montreal as well as in Cambodia, Haiti, and Lynn, Massachusetts.Samantha Fields\\xa0received $5,000 for \"desires not even our own\", a performative project disassembling one ton of used clothing that cannot be sold in thrift stores to act as a physical representation of material resources, the unseen labor of its makers, and a stand-in for our emotional person. The project will take place in Downtown Crossing over a period of eight weeks this fall.

Walsh today announced a partnership between Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS), the Mayor\\'s Housing Innovation Lab and the Office of Housing Stability to expand assistance for tenants facing court eviction with a new online tool,\\xa0Massachusetts Defense for Eviction (MADE).\\xa0MADE is a resource for tenants to refer to when faced with an eviction. The new web app makes it easier for tenants on their own to legally respond to their eviction cases, to keep track of key deadlines and to defend themselves in court. This tool complements existing work that the City has undertaken to inform tenants of their rights through a step-by-step online\\xa0Eviction Guide.\\xa0\"In Boston, we\\'re working hard to ensure families are able to stay in their neighborhoods and community as we build and maintain affordable housing,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Evictions can have a devastating effect on families, and MADE is one measure to support vulnerable tenants by giving them an easy to use tool that allows them to exercise their rights within the legal system.\"\\xa0As part of the Administration\\'s commitment to preventing displacement, Mayor Walsh recently announced a\\xa0housing security legislative package\\xa0submitted to the Massachusetts Legislature, which includes right to counsel in eviction proceedings, protection for elderly tenants from no-fault evictions and large rent increases, and ability for tenants and nonprofits to have the right of first refusal to purchase properties. Mayor Walsh\\xa0recently testified\\xa0at the Massachusetts State House in support of bills that would ensure the right to counsel in eviction proceedings and protections for older adults in just-cause evictions.The Office of Housing Stability and Greater Boston Legal Services strongly encourages tenants to respond to their court eviction hearing. By responding, tenants can better understand and assert their rights to potentially reach a more favorable outcome with their landlord. However, tenants have a limited amount of time from when they receive notice of their scheduled court hearing date to submit their legal responses to the court. This new online tool addresses some of the barriers that can prevent tenants from seeking assistance with their court eviction response.\"MADE is an online tool that empowers tenants and their families to fight an eviction and avoid homelessness. A tenant can use MADE to defend against an eviction while learning about their housing rights,\" said Quinten Steenhuis, Senior Attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services and creator of MADE. \"This can be powerfully effective for tenants who are facing a major crisis--homelessness--to prevent their evictions.\"\"GBLS is excited to have other ways to support people who need legal assistance, in view of our limited resources, \" said Jacquelynne J. Bowman, GBLS\\' Executive Director.MADE is a web app created by GBLS that tenants can use on their smartphone or desktop computer, which lets tenants respond to an eviction wherever and whenever is most convenient for them. Tenants can access the tool and complete the self-guided interview in as little as 25 minutes. The web app generates completed court paperwork with responses unique to a tenant\\'s housing situation, instructions on how to properly serve their legal paperwork, and automatic reminders of important dates sent through text and email.Tenants can either use MADE inside free legal clinics at Greater Boston Legal Services or other providers in the state, or at home on their own smartphone. This flexibility can be critical for working tenants, tenants with childcare needs, and tenants with disabilities that make it hard to attend a clinic at a fixed day and time. MADE fills a gap when tenants cannot meet face to face with a legal service provider to submit their responses within the time limit.\\xa0Users of MADE have already found the tool helpful in addressing eviction notices.\\xa0\"I am a tenant that stumbled across MADE while looking for help with forms,\" said Lisa Baker, a Massachusetts tenant. \"I think MADE from GBLS is an awesome and effective tool!\\xa0 Well thought out!\"Through the partnership between the Housing Innovation Lab, the Office of Housing Stability and GBLS, the MADE website will receive language enhancements that will better serve residents who consider Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Portuguese their primary language. The Office of Language and Communications Access reports 108,145 Boston residents (17.4 percent) self-identify to speak, read, write or understand English less than \"very well\".\\xa0\"Through the leadership of Mayor Walsh, the City of Boston is making incredible strides to expand the reach of city services by prioritizing the varied language and communications needs of constituents today,\" said Manar-ul Islam Swaby, Director of Language and Communication Access. \"This tool is a prime example of what accessibility can look like when done well - it addresses the experiences and challenges faced across diverse communities and designs for that difference.\"\\xa0About Greater Boston Legal ServicesGreater Boston Legal Services (GBLS) assists consumers, survivors of domestic violence, homeless families, elders, people with disabilities, homeowners facing foreclosure, tenants in no-fault evictions, low-wage workers, families with no source of income, and immigrants facing persecution.

The budget also includes an expansion in outreach services to provide assessment, crisis intervention and intensive case management services to unsheltered individuals drawn to spaces and resources of the Boston Public Library.Earlier this year, Heartland Alliance\\'s National Initiatives on Poverty & Economic Opportunity put out a call to communities across the nation for ideas on how to increase employment and income for people experiencing homelessness through systems change.

Walsh today announced Boston has been ranked the top U.S. city for energy efficiency, according to the\\xa02019 City Clean Energy Scorecard, shared today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Boston earned the highest score amongst cities for its building policies and a perfect score for its energy efficiency outreach and programs. No other city except Boston has ever held the top spot in the ACEEE city scorecard.\\xa0\"I\\'m proud of Boston for leading the rankings once again and am inspired by other cities for their bold action,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Through our work here in Boston, we\\'ve already surpassed our municipal climate goals and reduced emissions by 37 percent. If we\\'re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to accelerate our actions and lead by example--and that\\'s what we\\'ll keep doing here in Boston.\"The city scorecard tracks policy efforts to advance energy efficiency and, for the first time, renewable energy because both are needed to build a clean energy future and address climate change, according to ACEEE. Boston\\'s scoring recognized its efforts to increase renewable energy in the grid mix through programs such as its municipal energy initiative and its progress with community choice energy.\\xa0Boston\\'s municipal energy initiative, known as Renew Boston Trust, identifies energy-saving projects in City-owned buildings. The projects are self-funded through guaranteed energy and cost savings, meaning that they pay for themselves over time. Projects are already underway at 14 municipal buildings across Boston, including libraries, community centers, and police and fire stations. These projects range from lighting upgrades, water conservation measures, and solar panel installations.The City is also moving ahead with\\xa0municipal aggregation, also known as community choice energy. The aggregation will give Boston electricity customers more control over the kind of energy they use in their homes, and the price of that energy. The City is currently seeking approval from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities to proceed with its program. In addition to bringing cleaner energy to Boston homes and businesses, the City continues its partnership with utilities to reduce the amount of energy used in Boston through statewide energy efficiency programs.\\xa0Boston was also recognized for its long-standing work on energy benchmarking. The\\xa0Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance\\xa0(BERDO) reached 90 percent compliance in 2018, the most recent reporting year. 2019 now marks the first year of Energy Action and Assessment, which asks that large buildings demonstrate that they have taken steps to assess energy saving opportunities or reduce their energy use. City staff have supported building owners and operators with resources and technical assistance to help continuously improve the performance of Boston\\'s buildings over time.\"Cities are making impressive clean energy gains-taking big steps to waste less energy and encourage more renewable power. But they have more to do,\" said ACEEE senior research manager David Ribeiro, the lead report author. \"Cities must continue their push for innovative buildings policies, take greater steps to tackle transportation emissions, and better track progress to know which investments have the greatest impact. With their innovation, ingenuity, and resolve, they can build prosperous and equitable low-carbon communities.\"\\xa0According to ACEEE, the scorecard is the most comprehensive national report that tracks city progress toward climate goals. Boston is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Boston measures its progress through an annual community-wide greenhouse gas emissions inventory. In 2017, the Boston community emitted 6.1 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which represents a 21 percent decrease for 2005 emissions.\\xa0The City of Boston is currently updating its\\xa0Climate Action Plan, which will lay out strategies for achieving its carbon neutral goal. As a leading city on climate action, the City was named a winner of the\\xa0Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge\\xa0and received a support package, valued at up to $2.5 million, to increase low-carbon mobility choices and improve energy performance of Boston\\'s building sector.\\xa0###', 'BOSTON - Wednesday, July 24, 2019 - The City of Boston today joined the MBTA, the Allston Brighton community and the Liveable Streets Alliance to celebrate the opening of the Brighton Avenue bus/bike lane.

Brighton Avenue was identified as it serves two MBTA bus routes, the 57/57A and the 66, and more than 14,000 MBTA bus passengers ride on this stretch of roadway each day making it one of the system\\'s highest ridership locations. Boston Public School buses also travel along Brighton Avenue and will share the bus/bike lane as well.BTD expects the Brighton Avenue bus/bike lane could save as much as 40 percent of travel time during peak hours. Improvements are expected to be similar to those seen as a result of the bus/bike lane implemented by the City of Boston on Washington Street in Roslindale in 2018. Travel times on Washington Street have improved by 20-25 percent during peak hours, and daily ridership on MBTA buses operating at this location has increased with the addition of 160 new bus riders.\"BTD\\'s newly formed Transit Team, made possible with funding in Mayor Walsh\\'s FY19 operating budget, undertook a comprehensive public process to prepare for the installation of this lane,\" said City of Boston Chief of Streets Chris Osgood. \"This included outreach to the community, meetings with local stakeholders and engagement with transportation advocates such as the Liveable Streets Alliance.\"\"As a result of concerns expressed by community members during the public process, in addition to the implementation of the bus/bike lane, BTD also installed two new curbside zones on Brighton Avenue to allow for daytime commercial loading and evening passenger pick up/drop off,\" said Acting Boston Transportation Commissioner Gregory Rooney. \"These zones will work to reduce double parking, safely accommodate rideshare and other passenger vehicles, and support local businesses.The launch of the Brighton Avenue bus lane is part of a collaborative effort by the City and the MBTA to expand transit infrastructure and improve rider experience throughout Boston.\\xa0 Plans are underway for the implementation of another bus lane on heavily congested North Washington Street downtown.The Go Boston 2030 Vision and Action Plan is available for review at on\\xa0boston.gov.###\\xa0', 'Special events taking place on Saturday and Sunday, July 27 and 28,\\xa0will require street closings and parking restrictions in Boston.\\xa0 People coming into Boston to attend are encouraged not to drive their personal vehicles.\\xa0 Information on Bluebikes, the regional bike share service, may be found at http://bluebikes.com and information on the MBTA may be found at www.mbta.com.

Walsh today offered testimony before the Joint Committee on Financial Services at the Massachusetts State House in support of legislation that better aligns transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, with the City\\'s mobility goals. Additional revenue generated would be invested in local roads and transit, including projects that make Boston\\'s streets better for people who walk, bike, drive or take transit.\\xa0\\xa0The bill is part of Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0legislative package, which builds upon Boston\\'s work to ensure equity, opportunity and resilience for all residents by strengthening current systems and creating new tools to adapt, mitigate and invest in local transportation and the environment.Mayor Walsh testifies in support of \"An Act relative to transportation network company rider assessments\"\\xa0\"Transportation network companies have changed the way people travel. In some ways, they\\'ve made things more convenient but they\\'ve also increased congestion and added to the emissions that harm air quality and cause climate change,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"We have to find ways to make rideshares part of a sustainable and equitable transportation system, and this bill would help us do that.\"An Act relative to transportation network company rider assessments,\\xa0sponsored by Representative Michael Moran and Senator Joseph Boncore, would change the current per-trip assessment charged to TNCs operating in Massachusetts to better align it with the City\\'s and Commonwealth\\'s efforts to address congestion and lower emissions:\\xa0Incentivizing shared trips:\\xa0passengers would be charged 6.25 percent of the total fare for single-occupancy trips and 3 percent of the total fare for shared trips. Half of the revenue would go to the city or town in which the miles were driven, and the other half would go to the Commonwealth Transportation Fund and MassDevelopment.\\xa0Reducing congestion:\\xa0TNCs would be charged a per-mile fee of 20 cents for all miles traveled with no passengers during peak hours. Half of the revenue would go to the city or town in which the miles were driven, and the other half would go to the Commonwealth Transportation Fund and MassDevelopment.\\xa0Reducing carbon emissions:\\xa0all zero-emission vehicles would be exempt from the peak hour charge.\\xa0\"As the TNC industry has grown it has become clear that in urban areas the service has increased congestion - particularly during rush hours - and as a consequence carbon emissions,\" said Representative Michael Moran. \"I am pleased to join Mayor Walsh and Senator Boncore in support of this bill which will promote shared trips to reduce congestion while also encouraging the use of zero emission vehicles.\"\"I\\'m proud to join Mayor Walsh in supporting this bill,\" said Senator Joseph Boncore. \"With increased congestion on our roads, especially in East Boston and around the airport, we need to do all we can to incentivize good behavior, reduce demand and more efficiently use our roadways.\"In 2017 and 2018, more than 34 million and 42 million rideshare trips originated in Boston respectively. Currently, TNCs pay an assessment of 20 cents per ride that is distributed among municipalities, the Commonwealth\\'s general transportation fund, and the taxi and livery industry. Boston allocated the funds received from 2017 trips to increase street safety, including the improvement of sidewalks, markings and intersections improving the reliability of the network with smarter signals and curb management, and expanding access to transportation choices by enhancing the City\\'s bikeshare program.\\xa0The City of Boston has been piloting a program that designates curb space for ridesharing pick-ups and drop-offs, minimizing traffic disruptions that often accompany these services. Announced in the\\xa0Mayor\\'s Boston Municipal Research Bureau Speechin March, the City dedicated a zone for ridesharing activity in the Fenway, allowing these vehicles to continue to offer their transportation services, but in a way that supports the City of Boston\\'s Vision Zero safety goals and helps to improve traffic flow on Boston streets.Below are Mayor Walsh\\'s remarks, as prepared for delivery:Thank you, Chairman James Welch, Chairman Jamie Murphy, and members of the committee. My name is Martin J. Walsh and I\\'m the Mayor of Boston. I\\'m here to testify in support of H.1067/S.102: An Act Relative to Transportation Network Company Rider Assessments, sponsored by Representative Michael Moran and Senator Joseph Boncore.This legislation would help us build a transportation system that works for everyone--- for residents, for our economy, and for our environment. I welcome the opportunity to talk about why these changes are necessary.Transportation network companies have changed the way people travel. In some ways, they\\'ve made things more convenient. But they\\'ve also increased congestion, especially during rush hour. And they\\'re adding to the emissions that harm air quality and cause climate change. We have to find ways to make rideshares part of a sustainable and equitable transportation system. This bill would help us do that.This legislation would improve upon the TNC regulations already in place. It would adjust the assessment to better reflect and mitigate the impact on our streets and our environment. Right now, 20 cents per ride is collected and split between cities and towns, MassDevelopment, and the Commonwealth Transportation Fund. Last year, the City of Boston took in $3.4 million from TNC assessments. We are re-investing this money directly into things that make our entire transportation system better, whether you walk, bike, drive, take the T, or use ride shares. This is a good start. But honestly, it doesn\\'t go far enough.TNC\\'s should be contributing more to the public good, given the major impact they\\'re having on our streets. Look at the numbers: 42 million TNC rides started in Boston last year. That\\'s 115,000 every day. That\\'s more than one every second. Many of these rides happen during rush hour. And oftentimes, the pick-ups and drop-offs happen in a travel lane, including bus stops, bike lanes, and emergency vehicle areas. Increasing the assessment will help us ensure that the positives of this growing industry outweigh the negatives.As we increase the assessment, we also want to encourage more shared trips and fewer solo trips. This bill proposes an assessment of about $1 per solo trip, or 6.25% of the cost of the ride. For shared trips, the assessment is cut in half, to three percent.Additionally, this bill discourages empty trips during rush hour. How many of you have been sitting in traffic behind an Uber or a Lyft with no passengers in it? I\\'m sure we all have. We want to address this by introducing a 20 cent per mile charge if you\\'re driving around without a passenger during peak commuting hours.Finally, this bill also supports our efforts to make Boston carbon neutral by 2050. Of course, more carpooling is better for the environment. Our bill also provides a financial incentive for zero-emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles. Zero-emission vehicles will be exempt from any rush hour charge.\\xa0This legislation builds on the good work we\\'re already doing at the City level. We\\'ve got dedicated pick-up/drop-off zones for rideshares. We\\'re installing dedicated bus- and bike-only lanes. We\\'ve made historic capital investments in bike infrastructure, in electric vehicle infrastructure, and in road safety measures. And we created a Transit Team at City Hall to support the State\\'s work on the T. Making TNC\\'s work better for our city is the next logical and necessary step.This is one of several current bills that aim to improve the TNC situation in Boston and Massachusetts. I thank all of the advocates, the lawmakers, the Governor, and everyone who is also putting forward solutions. Together, we\\'re showing that there\\'s a growing demand for a better system--- one that works for residents, for our economy, and for our environment.I respectfully ask you to move forward those bills that best improve TNC regulations. I welcome conversation on how to achieve their goals. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I\\'m happy to answer any questions you have.\\xa0###', 'BOSTON - Tuesday, July 23, 2019 - Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced that the City of Boston has released a\\xa0Request for Proposals (RFP)\\xa0for affordable housing projects seeking City of Boston financial support. This $30 million funding round is almost twice the size of last year\\'s $16 million funding round, and is the largest affordable housing funding round since Mayor Walsh took office in 2014, and likely the largest in Boston\\'s history.\\xa0\"Building and preserving affordable housing in our city is one of our biggest efforts in Boston, and my administration will continue to invest heavily in these critical funds,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"These projects bring our commitment to affordable housing to more than $130 million, with more investments planned in the future. We will keep working to ensure all families are able to stay in their neighborhoods, and continue to call Boston home.\"\\xa0This $30 million 2019 funding round stipulates that winning proposals that provide deeper affordability -- at least an additional ten percent of units for extremely low-income households -- will be ranked most favorably. This stipulation for deep affordability goes beyond Boston\\'s standard set-aside of ten percent for formerly homeless households.\\xa0In addition, the City of Boston has strengthened its requirements for anti-displacement measures and is requiring that an additional 10 percent of units be made available to those earning less than 50 percent of Area Median Income (AMI), which is less than $50,000 for a two person household. Winning bidders must prove that they have not only earned the support of the communities where they propose to build, but also must document how their new development will not permanently displace current residents and businesses. Finally, special consideration will be given to any proposal that meets this criteria, and is a zero emission building.Based on the goals outlined in Mayor Walsh\\'s housing strategy\\xa0Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030\\xa0and the\\xa0Imagine Boston 2030\\xa0Planning Process, the City of Boston has established priority criteria which proposals must meet, including:\\xa0Affordable housing developments targeting a mix of incomes: from units for homeless households to units targeted and restricted to incomes representative of Boston\\'s workforce, including the low-income earners mentioned in this RFP\\xa0Affordable housing developments that serve the disabled community, vulnerable or special needs populations, older Bostonians, veterans, artists, and/or aging out youthAcquisition of unrestricted housing developments in order to stabilize residents\\' tenancies, and provide long term affordability for a mix of incomes orAffordable housing developments that utilize City-owned landAffordable housing developments that have reduced the cost to build and use public funding most efficientlyDevelopments that are at risk of losing their affordability within five years.Projects creating new affordable units in high-cost neighborhoods where most of the Inclusionary Development Program and Neighborhood Housing Trust Funds are generated.\"This new funding is groundbreaking not only because of the amount of money being offered to build affordable housing in Boston, but also because Mayor Walsh is investing new City resources to drive development of housing that provides deeper affordability,\" said Vanessa Calderón-Rosado, Chief Executive Officer of Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción, and co-chair of the Mayor\\'s Housing Advisory Task Force. \"This is a tremendous investment, and one that recognizes the importance of new development without displacement. I look forward to seeing the projects these new funds will generate.\"\"As a private developer of both affordable and market-rate properties, Beacon Communities appreciates Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to increasing the housing supply for a range of incomes,\" said CEO of the Beacon Communities Dara Kovel. \"We\\'ve got a pipeline of affordable\\xa0 housing developments that we are anxious to advance. The City of Boston\\'s financial investment, often the first investment in, makes it possible for us to leverage other public and private resources.\\xa0\"By releasing this new funding round, Mayor Walsh is illustrating that he is listening to the recommendations of Boston\\'s community in executing the Housing Boston 2030 plan,\" said Amy Schectman, 2Life Communities President and CEO. \"This RFP underscores that the City of Boston is willing to take the extra steps necessary to provide deeper affordability, a move that can only benefit our seniors and those in need of more affordable, supportive housing options.\"Funds will be awarded from three sources: the first, of approximately $10 million, consists of funds administered by the Department of Neighborhood Development, including funds from the Federal HOME Investment Partnerships and Community Development Block Grant programs, the City\\'s Housing Boston 2030 Fund, and the Inclusionary Development Policy Fund. The second source utilizes $10 million in funds from the Neighborhood Housing Trust (NHT). NHT disburses funds collected through the City\\'s Linkage policy, which extracts affordable housing funds from developers of large commercial projects. The third source is $10 million in Community Preservation Act Funds (CPA), which are collected through the one percent property tax surcharge approved by Boston voters in 2016 to help strengthen Boston neighborhoods through strategic investment in affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space. This is one of the CPA\\'s largest investments in housing.\\xa0About Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030In 2018, Mayor Martin J. Walsh updated his comprehensive housing strategy,\\xa0Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030\\xa0to increase the City\\'s overall housing goal from 53,000 to 69,000 new units by 2030, to meet Boston\\'s faster than expected population growth. These 69,000 new units include 15,820 new income-restricted units, which would elevate Boston\\'s income- restricted inventory total to 70,000, or one in five of all housing units. In addition, the 2018 update plan set a goal to preserve 85 percent of Boston\\'s most at-risk privately-owned affordable units, and to purchase 1,000 units of rental housing stock from the speculative market and income-restrict it for perpetuity.\\xa0Mayor Walsh\\'s 2019\\xa0housing security legislative package\\xa0focuses on expanding upon the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s affordable housing crisis and displacement risks for tenants by proposing new and strengthening current tools to leverage Boston\\'s prosperity and create sustainable wealth opportunities that make Boston a more inclusive and equitable city. The housing security bills proposed seek to help existing tenants, particularly the elderly, remain in their homes, and creates additional funding for affordable housing.\\xa0###', 'Boston’s first-ever zero waste plan, designed to move Boston towards becoming a zero waste city, was released in June 2019.

These 69,000 new units include 15,820 new income-restricted units, which would elevate Boston\\'s income-restricted inventory total to 70,000, or one in five of all housing units. In addition, the 2018 Update set a goal to preserve 85 percent of Boston\\'s most at-risk privately-owned affordable units, to purchase 1,000 units of rental housing stock from the speculative market and income-restrict it for perpetuity, and to help 5,000 Bostonians become first time homebuyers.\\xa0ABOUT THE COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT (CPA)After Boston voters adopted the CPA in November 2016, the City created a Community Preservation Fund. This fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017. The City uses this revenue to fund initiatives consistent with statewide CPA guidelines: affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and public recreation. The funding of any project requires a recommendation from the Community Preservation Committee and appropriation by the City.

Mayor Walsh appointed Talia Rivera as SOAR Boston\\'s director, the first woman to lead and oversee the program since it was created in the early 1990s.Under Rivera\\'s direction, SOAR Boston will work to reduce recidivism and intervene in violent activity by working towards the following goals:Rivera will use best practices from violence prevention and intervention efforts, as well as Boston-based data to meet the goals above and have a measurable impact on youth crime and violence in the City.

Walsh today offered testimony before the Joint Committee on the Judiciary at the Massachusetts State House in support of bills that would ensure the right to counsel in eviction proceedings and protections for older adults in just-cause evictions. The bills are part of Mayor Walsh\\'s legislative package, which focuses on expanding the work that Boston has done to address the region\\'s housing crisis by proposing new and existing tools to help existing tenants remain in their homes and create additional funding for affordable housing.\\xa0\"These bills rank among the highest priorities for the City of Boston this legislative session. They advance our commitment to being a city where everyone has access to a stable and secure home-regardless of income, age, or family situation,\" said Mayor Walsh in his testimony. \"They reflect our belief that a successful city must be a caring community, where nobody is left behind or forced to leave.\"An Act to ensure right to counsel in eviction proceedings, sponsored by Representative Chynah Tyler and Senator Sal DiDomenico would provide any low-income tenant facing eviction with a court-appointed attorney for representation. There were over 37,000 eviction filings resulting in 15,708 evictions in Massachusetts in 2016, according to the Eviction Lab. Landlords were represented by counsel in 58 percent of cases while tenants were represented by counsel in only 8 percent of cases.\\xa0\"I am proud to partner with Mayor Walsh and file this legislation to ensure the right to counsel in eviction proceedings for Massachusetts\\'s low-income residents. With an estimated 43 evictions in our Commonwealth every day, it is clear the current system isn\\'t working,\" said Senator Sal DiDomenico. \"To be certain, this statistic is not simply a number it represents the displacement of our most vulnerable residents like our seniors and families living in poverty. It\\'s time for us to level the playing field and adopt a right to counsel policy to help keep families in their homes.\"\"We have a big displacement crisis in the City of Boston and evictions are a large part of that,\" said Representative Chynah Tyler. \"My district has been hit the hardest by this problem and it will continue to get worse without some type of intervention. Expanding access to legal services in eviction proceedings is a necessary tool we need in order to prevent the negative effects of this crisis including homelessness.\"An Act relative to the just cause eviction of elderly lessees, sponsored by Representative Adrian Madaro would prohibit no-fault eviction of people over 75 years of age, limiting rent increases to 5 percent per year to prevent landlords from using large rent increases to get around just cause protections. Eviction would only be permitted for good cause such as, for example, failure to pay rent, damage to the property, use of the premises for illegal activities. Over the last six months, the housing team at the City\\'s Age Strong Commission has advocated for residents in 10 active court cases involving older Boston residents.\\xa0\"Elderly tenants are some of the most vulnerable members of our communities when it comes to displacement and eviction,\" said Representative Adrian Madaro. \"We should be caring for our seniors, not putting them out on the streets. I\\'m proud to partner with Mayor Walsh to offer this bill and spark the discussion about keeping our longtime residents in their homes.\"Below are Mayor Walsh\\'s remarks, as prepared for delivery:Good afternoon: Chairman [James] Eldridge, Chairwoman [Claire] Cronin, and members of the Committee. My name is Martin J. Walsh and I am the Mayor of Boston. I am here today to testify in support of legislation that would strengthen legal protections for elderly and low-income tenants of rental housing.The first is H.3373, An Act Relative to the Just Cause Eviction of Elderly Lessees, sponsored by Rep. Adrian Madaro. The second is S. 913 and H. 3456, An Act to Ensure Right to Counsel in Eviction Proceedings, sponsored by Sen. Sal DiDomenico and Rep. Chynah Tyler.These bills rank among the highest priorities for the City of Boston this legislative session. They advance our commitment to being a city where everyone has access to a stable and secure home-regardless of income, age, or family situation. And they reflect our belief that a successful city must be a caring community, where nobody is left behind or forced to leave.That\\'s why we\\'re building more subsidized housing than ever before. We\\'re continually working with nonprofit partners on creating and preserving senior housing. We created an Office of Housing Stability to support tenants facing displacement. And we\\'re investing city funds in public housing.But in light of increased housing demand and continual pressure on rents, our most vulnerable elders and families need protections-protections from eviction, from homelessness, and from all the traumas these crises inflict on our communities. That\\'s what these bills provide.H. 3373 would allow municipalities to protect our most vulnerable elderly residents from unfair evictions. Boston\\'s Age Strong Commission answers several calls each week from distraught seniors facing eviction-with an increasing number from seniors over the age of 75. These seniors call us because they have nowhere else to turn, and nowhere else to live. In one case, a 77-year-old man has lived in his home in the Fenway for over 40 years, but this summer received notice to quit, with no cause given. In another, an 88-year-old lives in a building that was sold, and the new landlord wants a big rent increase that he can\\'t possibly afford. This treatment is not acceptable for seniors who spent their lives here and helped build our communities.Our legislation would provide tenants over the age of 75 with \"just cause\" protection. This term simply means that landlords must provide a legitimate reason for eviction, such as failure to pay rent, damage to the property, or illegal activity. Landlords could still raise rents each year by as much as five percent. And the bill exempts properties with five or fewer units-because we know that some small property owners are renting at below-market rents to long-term elderly tenants. We want to protect those arrangements and we want to protect our most vulnerable seniors.For the wider population of tenants who face eviction, right-to-counsel legislation would provide much-needed access to justice. It would make legal representation in eviction proceedings a right, just like it is for defendants in criminal cases. If a tenant could not afford their own attorney, one would be appointed for them by the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services.This is not about stacking the deck in favor of a tenant-it\\'s about ensuring equal justice under the law. Currently, there is a large imbalance in access to counsel between landlords and tenants. In the most recent data, landlords were represented by counsel in over 58% of cases, while tenants were represented in just eight percent of cases.That means over 9 out of 10 tenants facing eviction do not have a lawyer present for one of the most life-altering and potentially damaging legal situations they will ever face.Evidence from other cities, including New York, shows that right-to-counsel reduces evictions and has a positive impact on court efficiency. Counsel can help negotiate mutually beneficial outcomes, such as a payment agreement or an extension of time to find alternative housing.\\xa0One recent case came to the attention of our Office of Housing Stability. A tenant had been evicted after 21 years, with no legal representation. He had missed a few hundred dollars of rent-but at the same time, the landlord had failed to repair faulty windows. If he had counsel, they could have argued that these conditions deserved more lenient treatment, and worked out an agreement that helped both sides meet their obligations.Finally, the cost of providing counsel would be at least partially offset by savings in homeless services. According to a 2014 study, 15% of evicted families and 20% of evicted individuals in Massachusetts wind up in shelter. With up to 43 evictions happening in our state every day, we could save from $12 to $35 million on emergency housing and shelter costs annually.Right to counsel is a significant step, and this legislation would not take it lightly. It calls for a public task force, reporting back to the Legislature on an implementation plan that takes into account recruitment, standards, data sharing, and cost. The right to counsel would not go into effect until two years after the task force\\'s report.\\xa0Eviction was once considered an inevitable outcome of poverty. Today, experts like Harvard\\'s Matthew Desmond have shown that eviction, in fact, perpetuates poverty and deepens inequality. Evictions disproportionately harm women of color, especially single mothers. They disrupt children\\'s education, health, and social development. They trap families in poverty and block upward mobility. It\\'s no exaggeration to call eviction a national social crisis. Here in the Commonwealth, we should maintain our national leadership by responding to this crisis with just, humane, and effective policies.Before I close, I want to add my support to another piece of legislation you will hear today. The HOMES Act is filed by Majority Leader Mike Moran and Sen. Joseph Boncore, as H. 3566 and S. 824, and it enjoys the support and advocacy of Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards. It would seal court records from landlords and prohibit asking applicants about housing history-when applying for housing, shelter, jobs, credit, or employment. It\\'s another way we can limit the damage caused by evictions, support economic mobility, and strengthen our communities.I respectfully ask you to recommend passage of the bills I\\'ve mentioned today. I welcome continued conversation and discussion of these and related pieces of legislation. I thank you for the opportunity to speak and I\\'m happy to answer any questions you may have.\\xa0###', 'Mayor Martin J.

This year the Mayor\\'s Office of Food Access added 13 total Summer Eats meal sites, including a new mobile meal site which will provide meals in at least one neighborhood per day around the City. In addition to food insecurity, the program addresses and mitigates summer learning loss by providing educational and fun activities.\"The YMCA of Greater Boston will serve approximately 300,000 meals at more than 80 locations this summer,\" said James Morton, President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater Boston.\\xa0 \"During the summer months, 80.3 percent of students who eat lunch at school during the school year do not participate in a summer food program, and we are pleased to join the Mayor\\'s Office of Food Access and others to end childhood hunger in Boston.\"In Eastern Massachusetts, one in nine children and one in eleven adults live with food insecurity. Food insecurity is defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as lack of access to enough food for an active, healthy life.\\xa0\"Hunger doesn\\'t disappear in the summer. The same students who count on school food for more than half their daily nutrition are at risk for summer hunger and learning loss when school is on break and those meals are unavailable,\" says Erin McAleer, President of Project Bread. \"Summer Eats is an effective way to close that gap. We can help kids and teens stay healthy so they are both ready to learn when it is time to head back to school and also more likely to stay healthy in the future.\"Boston Summer Eats sites, supported and managed by the Mayor\\'s Office of Food Access, are funded by the Boston Children\\'s Hospital Collaboration for Community Health.

Walsh, along with the City\\'s Chief of Operations Patrick Brophy, Boston Public Library president David Leonard, and members of the community gathered yesterday to celebrate the groundbreaking of the renovated Adams Street Branch of the Boston Public Library. The event celebrated the start of construction for the renovated Adams Street branch, an $18.3 million collaborative development including the City of Boston Public Facilities Department and the Boston Public Library, in partnership with NADAAA Architects and J and J Contractors Inc.\"Our public libraries represent our shared values. The investments we are making in our neighborhood libraries are a direct reflection of the love of libraries that I see and hear from our residents,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"If you go to any branch library in the city after school, you will see children from all different backgrounds reading books, asking questions, doing projects, and exploring worlds of imagination and information. They\\'re finding material to build their dreams with, and I\\'m proud that we\\'re creating new spaces for them to do exactly that.\"\\xa0\\xa0The Adams Street Branch opened in its current location in 1951 as one of six branches in Dorchester, but until now, had seen limited capital investment since its establishment. A 2016 feasibility study, undertaken by the BPL, the Public Facilities Department, the community, and the design team helped identify the community\\'s goals and priorities for the renovation, such as transparency, inclusion, and access.\\xa0\\xa0New amenities in the Adams Street Branch will include updated technology, expanded program space, and high-performance, sustainable systems. Enhancements over the former library will include a more accessible front door, easier access to library collections, a larger Community Room, new study and conference rooms, and a music room.The future Adams Street Branch doubles the size of the current branch, and will also include:\\xa0The building landscape is planned as a tribute to the 20th\\xa0century Adams Street Branch and is a sustainable, low-maintenance green space. At the southern edge, along Delmont Avenue, the building splits to draw additional light into the Adult and Children\\'s sections, as well as creating a rain garden will absorb much of the roof\\'s run-off. On the northern side, along Oakton Avenue, a great heritage Pin Oak will remain, and the Reading Garden will be recreated with expanded seating and space for outdoor programs.\"The Friends of the Adams Street Branch Library along with members of the community are excited about today\\'s groundbreaking,\" said Grace Hebard, president of the Friends of the Adams Street Branch Library. \"We would like to thank Mayor Walsh and the Boston Public Library for this significant investment in this neighborhood treasure. We appreciate the process that allowed us to give input into the design of the new library, and look forward to our continued involvement through construction and beyond.\"\\xa0The Adams Street Branch Library will close at the end of service on Friday, July 12, 2019. Library services will continue at the Fields Corner and Lower Mills branches. The Lower Mills branch will reopen on Saturday, July 13, following a $226,000 renovation, including replacement of the Borrowers Service desk and flooring, along with painting throughout the branch.These renovations represent a significant investment in the City\\'s branch libraries as part of Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0capital budget. The Mayor\\'s capital plan includes a $127 million investment in Boston\\'s library system, including\\xa0a $12.6 million renovation at the Faneuil Branch Library and $10.2 million renovation at the Roslindale Branch Library programming studies for the West End, Codman Square and Uphams Corner branches a comprehensive $17.2 million building renovation at the Dudley Branch Library finalization of a programming study for a new Fields Corner Branch Library and a $15.7 million renovation project at the Central Library in Copley Square, which will enhance the preservation of BPL\\'s historic special collections.\\xa0Rendering of the future Adams Street Branch of the Boston Public Library.', 'When the Digital Team creates tools and services, our focus is on everyone. We want to build experiences that are accessible to as many people as possible. But, in some cases, we work on projects where our target audience is smaller and much more specific. That’s definitely the case with our efforts around the Mayor’s Office of Returning Citizens. The office supports those who return to Boston after being released from state, federal, and county jails and prisons each year. They also help those who were previously incarcerated.The people Returning Citizens attempts to reach often face challenges different from those encountered by the general public. To get a better understanding of how these folks would like to connect with important resources through Boston.gov, we teamed up with one of our local partners, General Assembly. They tasked a cohort of students in their User Experience Design Immersive with figuring out how to create a better experience for them on Boston.gov. The blog post below was written by the students about their experience.To get started, we held a kickoff meeting with the Digital Team and the Office of Returning Citizens. Returning Citizens was established in 2017 to support the re-entry of individuals coming out of incarceration. Our goal was to first understand the needs of people who are facing re-entry. We then used what we learned from that research to propose a redesign of their presence on Boston.gov.At the time we started working on the project, their site functioned more like an “about” page explaining the office. We saw an opportunity to create a page that acts like more of a support platform to directly point returning citizens to the services they may need. We were inspired by the fact that our design decisions could support a community member’s re-entry goals.In just one week, we interviewed 14 people, each navigating a different phase of the re-entry process. These interviews were conducted at the Returning Citizens office and at the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department. The first part of our interviews focused on learning about each person’s:The second part of our interviews focused on the current webpage. Each person provided feedback on what they would expect and like to see.Aside from interviews, we also performed a comparative analysis of other local government offices in the United States that have the same mission as Returning Citizens. We looked at relevant websites for eight different offices and compared different elements on the pages, including:We would later leverage some of these elements within the design we proposed.After talking with our users, we synthesized our data by grouping like concerns together to point out user needs and pain points. We then used an exercise called affinity mapping to identify the major challenge areas of our primary users. From this exercise, we defined the themes of our primary users as:We found that the majority of our primary users faced challenges with technology. We realized that we could not assume people have access to the Returning Citizens homepage. We proposed two solutions:As part of our work, we also defined a secondary user. Our research showed family and friends are using the page for information as well. We needed to make sure the solutions we designed spoke to them.After finalizing our research data and identifying our user needs, we came up with specific design features. If a proposed design feature fit more than one user need, we made sure to include it. This helped us narrow our scope to get to the key points addressed in our project. We set out to do a timed design studio. Our goal was to flesh out ideas and create a visual representation of designs that we could test with users.Usability tests allow us to view how screens flow with one another, and how users naturally interact with the design. We can figure out pretty quickly what works and doesn’t work as a user goes through this flow. Many of the users we spoke to just wanted to see one of three things:Simplicity was key in our design. We created one page with all of our user needs provided as links on the page. In a section titled, “I’m looking for…”, we placed relevant information in buckets that would jump users to pages with more detailed information. We also made sure that a general intake form was easily accessible for users.\\n\\nSketches of the Returning Citizens redesign.\\n\\n\\nKeeping in line with the City of Boston’s brand guidelines, it was critical for us to keep the wording conversational and easy-to-understand. Where we could in our designs, we also created a “step” system that guided people through what process they needed help with. We felt this type of design would help with trust and overall goal planning.Unfortunately, our project ran out of time before we were able to test out our new designs on users. But, we feel that we’ve laid the foundation for City staff to continue these efforts.With just three weeks to work on this project, we found that balancing expectations and adapting to changes were key learning points for our team. We were also continuously amazed and enlightened by the courageous efforts of those who work each day to help those affected by incarceration.We would like to thank those we spoke to who helped us gain insight into the Office of Returning Citizens and the re-entry journey. We were humbled and reminded of how much we take for granted in terms of access to information.General Assembly offers accelerated courses for in-demand skills in tech. The students we worked with were part of the Spring 2019 User Experience Design Immersive. Their work on Returning Citizens was a final project that they completed over three weeks. The students who took part in the project were Jenn Andersen, Cindy Matos, Lydia Gamache, and Perry DeNicola.', '', 'Special events taking place from Friday, July 12, through Sunday, July 14, will require street closings and parking restrictions in Boston.\\xa0 People coming into Boston to attend are encouraged not to drive their personal vehicles.\\xa0 Information on Bluebikes, the regional bike share service, may be found at http://bluebikes.com and information on the MBTA may be found at www.mbta.com.

Respondents should focus on how their recommendations would decrease food waste, create cost savings for the City, decrease environmental impacts and support the City’s goals to go carbon neutral by 2050.The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to narrow respondents’ scope by asking them to focus on how the City can reduce the amount of organics (food and yard waste) that is disposed of through weekly curbside trash collection. This RFI is looking for respondents to consider short term (2019-2024) solutions to this problem while considering the effectiveness of increasing the City’s composting services, increasing the usage of garbage disposals and rolling out a large scale communications plan to educate residents how to better utilize these systems and how they can contribute to improving the environmental health of the City. We are also asking respondents to look at this problem and provide recommended solutions through a financial perspective in addition to environmental impacts.While specific contracts are outside the scope of this solicitation, the City of Boston hopes to gain a comprehensive understanding of options currently available to reduce food and yard waste from ending up in incinerators. From this information, the City of Boston expects to confirm and narrow its interest in such an arrangement before proceeding with a full Request for Proposals (RFP) which respondents to this RFI can help shape, and therefore be in a stronger position when an RFP is published.

The new parking meter fees reflect current demand for short-term parking in Boston and will help to ease congestion on the City’s busiest streets.”The revised fees build off of the learnings from the two-year performance parking pilot program in the Back Bay and South Boston Waterfront, two areas with the highest parking demand in Boston. Taking a different approach in each neighborhood, the City adjusted meter rates and observed the impact on parking availability. The pricing approach taken in the Back Bay, where the City applied a consistent price over a larger area, showed the most positive results, as double-parking decreased by 14 percent, and illegal parking decreased by an average of 22 percent. During this pilot, on average a parking space was available on every block.The new rates going into effect on Monday, July 1 include:The City of Boston last raised parking meter fees citywide in 2011 when the hourly rate increased from $1.00 to $1.25.Residential neighborhoods which do not have parking meters will not see a change. As a result of this improvement, the City expects that the benefits of smarter pricing will also reach these other areas - it will be easier to find a parking space there will be less illegal parking there will be less double parking all leading to less congestion and lower emissions.Even with these updates, Boston continues to have some of the lowest parking meter prices in the country, with other municipalities' hourly rates at up to $4/hour (Seattle), and up to $6.50/hour (San Francisco and Chicago). Expanding the approach across Boston will not only make parking easier, but also generate additional revenue to improve Boston's transportation network.With the additional revenue these parking changes bring, Boston will re-invest the funds, estimated to reach $5 million, by moving ahead on projects identified in Go Boston 2030 that are designed to create equitable, safe and functional streets for all.Richard Dimino, President and CEO of A Better City said, “This incremental increase in Boston’s parking meter rate makes sense. For businesses, the parking meter is meant to provide short term spaces for customers. The new rate will encourage turnover, which at the end, increases the availability of space. Also pleased to see the use of meter revenue tied to efforts to improve transit access.”In addition to increased parking meter revenue, Boston is now in its second year of collecting the 10 cent per ride revenue from Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), like Uber and Lyft, which will result in about $3 million in funding available for transportation projects in FY20. In his legislative package, Mayor Walsh has also proposed further measures to encourage shared TNC rides, and reduce congestion in Boston. This TNC revenue will contribute to funding anti-congestion efforts Citywide, as well as safety and public realm improvements.With funding secured in Mayor Walsh’s FY2019 budget, in the past year the City of Boston has created within BTD a Transit Team that is focusing on implementing bus lanes and other public transit improvements, and a New Mobility Team focusing on the rideshare industry, scooters and additional contemporary transportation options. This funding has also provided for the expansion of BTD’s Active Transportation Team focusing on the construction of a network of connected bike lanes extending throughout the City, expanding Bluebikes, the popular bike share program owned by the City of Boston and its partner municipalities of Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville and Everett, and the expansion of Neighborhood Slow Streets zones on residential streets in the City.Performance Parking is a priority project of Go Boston 2030, the City of Boston’s comprehensive transportation plan.\", 'In partnership with the University of Massachusetts Boston Office of Career Services and Internships and the Mayor’s Office of Community Partnerships,\\xa0we hosted the first \"Boston City Insider\"\\xa0career networking event\\xa0at UMass Boston.

In this role, he fostered relationships with community, interfaith, and political leaders to raise the mosque\\'s public profile, combat hateful rhetoric, and facilitate the\\xa0Muslim community\\'s integration into Boston.\"Having immigrated from India at the age of nine, I know how hard it is for families to find their footing in a new place and culture, particularly during current times of divisive and ugly rhetoric,\" said Yusufi Vali. \"I am excited to lead our City\\'s efforts in ensuring immigrants feel right at home, have access to opportunities, and contribute to Boston\\'s growth and well-being, just as immigrants have done throughout our country\\'s history.\"In his role as executive director at the ISBCC, Vali developed a strategic framework via a rigorous needs-assessment of congregants, which led to the doubling of ISBCC programs and services. As one of Vali\\'s first actions as executive director, he organized a series of meetings with Jewish and Christian leaders which fostered a supportive interfaith relationship.Vali also led the response of the ISBCC in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, sharing Muslim values and reassuring Boston\\'s Muslim community that their city would continue to be a welcoming place for everyone. Vali has consistently advocated against stigmatizing federal policies and programs, most recently the Trump Administration\\'s Muslim ban. Vali and his team organized multiple \"Know Your Rights\" trainings, educating hundreds of community members, business, political and civic leaders, on the policy.Before joining the ISBCC in 2012, Vali was a community organizer with the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, where he advocated for better education and access to health care for low-income families. He was a Fulbright Scholar, a Marshall Scholar, and is currently a Barr\\xa0Fellow. He holds two master\\'s degrees from the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies, and a bachelor\\'s degree from Princeton University.\"MIRA welcomes the Mayor\\'s appointment of Yusufi Vali as the director of the Office for Immigrant Advancement,\" said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA). \"He has a known track record of championing immigrant and refugee issues. He will be a tremendous asset to the Mayor and the city.\"MOIA endeavors to strengthen immigrant participation in Boston\\'s diverse civic, social, economic, and cultural life. The office also promotes the recognition and public understanding of immigrant contributions to the City of Boston, and serves as the City agency leading the efforts to mitigate the impact of federal immigration restrictions on the City\\'s immigrants.Mayor Walsh and Councilor Josh Zakim recently announced amendments to the \"Boston Trust Act,\"\\xa0a City ordinance that delineates the work of local law enforcement officials and federal immigration laws. Since the start of the\\xa0 Trump Administration\\'s reform on the immigration system, Mayor Walsh has been opposed to proposed changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), the proposed redefinition of \"public charge\" and HUD\\'s proposed rule to expel from public housing mixed-status families paying prorated rent.Mayor Walsh recently included $50,000 in his\\xa0FY20 Budget proposal\\xa0dedicated to the Greater Boston Immigrant Defense Fund, which strives to increase education and access to legal services to defend its many immigrant communities, refugees, and temporary status holders. This supplements MOIA\\'s ongoing efforts n this area such as\\xa0Immigrant Information Corners, with multilingual information about citizenship, financial empowerment, and public and community resources. MOIA also offers free immigration clinics at City Hall, and has facilitated \"Know Your Rights\" and \"Immigration 101\" presentations to communities and service providers. Since 2014, MOIA has co-hosted Citizenship Day in Boston, which has helped more than 1,000eligible immigrants apply for citizenship.The MOIA mini-grant program has awarded almost $200,000 to Boston-based, immigrant-led and immigrant-serving non-profit organizations, which has served over 2,000 constituents through programs such as ESOL classes, legal screening clinics, citizenship application assistance, youth mentoring, and civic engagement classes.Under Mayor Walsh, MOIA has been a model for municipal governments motivated to support and advance its diverse immigrant communities. MOIA held the regional Municipal Leaders for Immigrant Advancement Summit at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in 2017 and the first national best practices convening of the\\xa0Cities for Action\\xa0coalition at Suffolk University in 2018.

Walsh today announced Boston’s first-ever zero waste plan, designed to move Boston towards becoming a zero waste city. The recommendations include 30 near- and long-term strategies for reducing both consumption of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions. Key parts of the plan include expanding Boston’s composting program, increasing access to recycling opportunities and launching a city-wide education campaign on recycling.By implementing the strategies over time, Boston can reduce trash, and increase recycling and composting by about 638,000 tons per year, increasing Boston’s current recycling rate from approximately 25 percent to 80 percent by 2035. Approximately six percent of Boston’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the City’s discarded materials. By reducing waste, recycling more, and composting, Boston can reduce emissions associated with waste and move one step closer to its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.“Preparing Boston for climate change means ensuring our city is sustainable, both now and in the future,” said Mayor Walsh. “We need to lead, and design city policies that work for our residents, and for the environment and world we depend upon. These initiatives will lead Boston towards becoming a zero waste city, and invest in the future of residents and generations to come.”The new initiatives are included in a set of recommendations by the Zero Waste Boston Advisory Committee appointed by Mayor Walsh last year. The committee, led jointly by the Chief of Streets, Transportation & Sanitation and the Chief of Environment, Energy & Open Space, was tasked with developing recommendations of short- and long-term policies and programs that would lead to major reductions of solid waste in all sectors of the Boston community. The committee was supported by staff from the Public Works and Environment Departments and a team of experts including Perlmutter Associates, Zero Waste Associates, and the Center for EcoTechnology.“We’re devoting significant resources to achieve both our short and long term goals and ensure our City is more sustainable for decades to come,” said Chief of Streets and Zero Waste Co-Chair, Chris Osgood. “By implementing these recommendations, there is no doubt that Boston can achieve the ultimate goal of becoming a Zero Waste City.”\"By implementing Boston’s first zero waste plan, we will be a healthier and greener City for future generations to come,” said City Councilor Matt O’Malley and the Chairman of the Council\\'s Environment, Sustainability and Parks Committee. “I am proud to have spearheaded the Council’s efforts to institute curbside composting and textile recycling programs in the City of Boston and I look forward to seeing these programs develop even further. I want to thank Mayor Walsh for his leadership on this issue and his steadfast commitment to keeping Boston a leader on all environmental matters facing cities across the world. Expanding Boston’s composting program will be transformative in improving the City’s recycling rate, reducing our waste, and greenhouse gas emissions, while working toward carbon neutrality.”“Healthy communities and a healthy environment are critical to the health and wellness of every person. We are excited about the health, economic, social, and environmental opportunities and impact the ‘zero waste’ plan will bring to the City of Boston, the Commonwealth, and the greater New England region,” said Monica Nakielski, Director, Sustainability and Environmental Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, and a member of the Zero Waste Advisory Committee.Currently Boston residents and businesses generate roughly 1.2 million tons of materials annually, where 25 percent is reused, recycled or composted and 75 percent is disposed in incinerators or landfills. The Zero Waste Committee recommended 30 overall strategies within four core categories to increase composting, recycling and reuse:Approximately 36 percent of what is currently thrown away as trash is, in fact, compostable materials -- either yard waste such as leaves and grass clippings or food scraps. Diverting compostable materials out of the trash is a top priority for the Zero Waste Plan.Following the recommendations in the report, the City will extend the current residential yard waste collection service from 17 weeks during the April to December period to 20 weeks. To provide residents with even more options, there will be at least 20 weekend days when residents can drop off yard waste at Boston’s composting facility on American Legion Highway, at no cost. Some of the compost generated from that yard waste will be provided at no cost to Boston’s community gardens other compost will be available for sale to Boston residents at a reduced price.In addition to expanding yard waste collection, the City will pilot curbside collection of food waste from residents. The City will shortly issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify a local partner or partners to provide this service for a subscription cost, with a portion of that cost covered by the City. That partnership is set to begin this fall.Roughly 39 percent of what is thrown away as trash is recyclable. The City will take several steps to expand recycling both at home and in public.The City will soon release a new Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify local partners to educate and encourage Boston residents to recycle textiles, such as clothing and linens, through a free curbside service. The partnership is set to begin this fall.Additionally, earlier this year, Boston was selected as one of seven U.S. communities to receive a $250,000 grant for a community recycling pilot program from The Coca-Cola Foundation. This grant will support the Fund for Parks and Recreation in Boston and build on the City’s ongoing efforts to improve access to recycling and encourage better recycling behaviors. The pilot program will bring recycling bins, signage and collection services to City parks to further expand the reach of recycling services in areas with high foot traffic.The City recently launched a new citywide education campaign called Recycle Right, which is informed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) education campaign efforts. This initiative focuses on placing the proper materials in the recycling bin and separating “problem materials” that cause contamination and drive up the cost of recycling. New signage and online materials will help residents better understand what items can and can’t be recycled, and highlight where and when household hazardous waste drop-off events are being held.Reducing the creation of materials that wind up being discarded in the first place is also a top priority recommended by the Zero Waste Advisory Commission.Last December, the City rolled out its new ordinance to eliminate single-use plastic bags in Boston. Plastic bags often end up in our streets and gutters, vacant lots, and trees. They’re harmful to Boston’s marine life and pollute the city’s waterways. The City encourages all customers to switch to reusable bags, which can be used time and time again without tossing them in the trash.In the Fiscal Year 2020 budget, the City is investing $175,000 to build on the success of the plastic bag ban and implement strategies identified in the new report. The Environment and Public Works Departments will work together to increase behavior change for residential waste and to improve the quality of residents’ recycling efforts.Achieving zero waste will require further product, technology, and business model innovation.Boston is taking steps to spark innovation and strengthen the local economy focused on this industry. In addition to the new requests for proposals for residential composting and textiles, the City will seek information from interested parties for a potential large-scale program that would reduce the amount of food and yard waste that residents currently dispose of in their curbside collection. The Request for Information (RFI) aims to identify solutions that would increase the City’s composting services and expand local or regional composting capacity.The City of Boston also encourages residents to utilize tools like the City’s free “Trash Day” app. The app enables Boston residents to search a directory of hundreds of household items to find out the right way to dispose of them while on the go or at home. App users can also view a calendar for their home’s collection dates, set reminders and get notifications of schedule changes.Completing a zero waste plan marks an important milestone in Mayor Walsh’s work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was one of the actions called out in Boston’s 2014 Climate Action Plan. The climate plan, which is currently being updated, will soon provide immediate next steps for Boston to take to become carbon neutral by 2050. While reducing emissions, the City is working to prepare for sea level rise and the impacts of climate change. Resilient Boston Harbor is the City’s vision plan to strengthen Boston’s 47-mile shoreline through expanded and connected green space. The City has already completed segments of the vision through district-level projects in East Boston, Charlestown, and South Boston, and is currently working on climate resiliency measures for Downtown and Dorchester.', 'The My Way Cafe\\xa0model, operated by Boston Public School’s Food and Nutrition Services and funded by the Shah Family Foundation, is a model where schools prepare food themselves in their own kitchens and give students a choice in what they want to eat, similar to fast casual restaurants, such as Chipotle. Mayor Walsh discussed how he had seen it running in East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury, and how happy students were to be eating the new food. He asked questions of students in the audience, getting them excited for the new cafeteria that they will experience next year.Meals will still be provided at no cost to all Boston Public Schools students, which has been the case since 2014. Since 80 percent of families are determined economically disadvantaged, the district qualifies for free school meals for all students. The goal of this program is to have students taking and eating the food so that they can benefit. Interim Superintendent Laura Perille spoke as well about why this makes school food so crucial to students’ success. She reminded onlookers that the ability to choose is an important element as well, as students are more likely to participate in something they have a say in.Finally, Jill Shah, president of the Shah Family Foundation which provides a majority of the funding for this program, had four students do an unveiling of what the cafeteria blueprint looks like now, versus what it will look like after the construction this summer. A wall will be knocked down in the back of the cafeteria to provide room for more ovens, sinks, and other appliances required to prepare fresh food on site. Since the Kenny and two-thirds of other Boston Public\\xa0schools were built before World War II, when students walked home for lunch, these schools have no kitchens. She said that she was proud that the City is investing $7.9 million to expand this program to about 30 more schools next year.Some of the favorite dishes by students at other My Way Cafe schools that started this year or earlier include: the choice of spaghetti pasta with tomato sauce or meatballs or both, along with a vegetable side, a choice of cheese on top of the pasta, and other vegetable options. There is also a day where students can choose between a hamburger, cheeseburger, or grilled cheese, with potato wedges and corn on the cob on the side. There will be a salad bar available every day, with options for yogurt parfaits or different fruits for breakfast. The students are very excited to try the new food items and I get asked questions about them constantly.This post was written by Sarah Curless, FoodCorps\\xa0AmeriCorps Service Member at the Thomas J.

Walsh and the Boston Public Schools today announced the launch of a pilot program that will bring free menstrual supplies to 77 BPS schools throughout the district. This program will start in the fall of the 2019 school year.\"This pilot program is about equity in our schools, and among our young people,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Nearly one in five girls in the U.S. have left school early, or missed school all together because they didn\\'t have access to menstrual products.\\xa0I\\'m proud BPS continues to be a leader in equity, ensuring our students have the resources they need, and access to the same opportunities.\"The pilot will include all 77 schools that teach students in grades 6 to 12. BPS School Health Services will order the menstrual products centrally and distribute them to the school nurses\\' offices at the beginning of the school year and as needed throughout the year. After the initial pilot, nurses will partner with selected teachers who will also give out menstrual supplies.\"I\\'m grateful to Mayor Walsh for funding this important program, and making sure that girls in BPS don\\'t have to choose between taking care of their health, and going to class,\" said Laura Perille, Interim BPS Superintendent. \"Offering free, easily accessible menstrual supplies means that more students will have access to the supplies they need, and are able to stay in class and focus on their education.\"The $100,000 investment for the pilot program was part of Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20 budget, resubmitted to the Boston City Council today.Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20 resubmitted budget also increased the BPS appropriation by an additional $38.7 million to a total of $1.177 billion after the successful completion of the collective bargaining agreement between the Boston Teachers Union and the Boston Public Schools. The FY20 BPS budget will grow by $51 Million or 4.5 percent and makes targeted investments that directly support students and families, increases per-pupil spending, supports critical academic investments, and expands access to exam school admissions. The FY20 BPS budget reflects an increase in per-pupil spending by 25 percent over the past six years, from about $16,500 in FY14 to over $20,700 in FY20.', 'Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Governor Charlie Baker, and the family of Martin Richard today joined hundreds of residents to celebrate the opening of Martin\\'s Park at the Smith Family Waterfront. Adjacent to Boston Children\\'s Museum, the City of Boston Parks Department created an inclusive park and play space that is the first-of-its-kind in the City. The Department oversaw the project honoring Martin W. Richard, the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings. Located at 64 Sleeper Street on the South Boston waterfront, Martin\\'s Park is a climate-resilient park that provides a space for children, families, and visitors of all abilities to learn, grow and play.\"Over the past two years, we\\'ve witnessed the incredible transformation of Martin\\'s Park into a world-class space for everyone in Boston to enjoy,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Parks are the heart and soul of our city. Martin\\'s spirit will always be alive in Boston, and because of the work of the Richard family, countless families will come together at this park and share in the love, compassion and hope one special young boy taught us.\"Martin\\'s Park was designed in collaboration with landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh and built by contractor MacKay Construction, with features including a reflection and water play garden, amphitheater, ship, and Martin\\'s favorite, a cosmo climber. Five cherry trees are planted in memory of Sean Collier, Dennis Simmonds, Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, and Martin Richard.\"Today\\'s\\xa0celebration is a testament to the dedication of the Richard family and all those that have supported them in this work,\" said Governor Charlie Baker. \"Martin\\'s Park will undoubtedly bring joy to so many young people and families in the Commonwealth, and I am grateful for the efforts that have made this park a reality.\"Growing up in Dorchester, Martin spent much of his time playing with siblings Henry and Jane and their friends at many of the fields and playgrounds throughout the city. Designed with people of all ages and abilities in mind, Martin\\'s Park will be a symbol of Martin\\'s welcoming, inclusive nature, as well as his dream of an ideal park. This unique, public and free outdoor space will ensure that Martin\\'s legacy remains a vibrant and positive influence for future generations.\"We are forever grateful for the unwavering support of our donors, volunteers and city officials that have made Martin\\'s Park possible, and we are thrilled to share this special place with everyone in the city of Boston,\" said Bill Richard. \"For us, Martin\\'s Park is a symbol of the commitment of so many individuals and their dedication to building a more kind, just, and inclusive community here in the city that we love.\"Martin\\'s Park includes north and south play areas connected by a raised bridge, creating a cohesive play space while allowing much-needed neighborhood and visitor pedestrian circulation to move through the space. Sloped pathways throughout the site feature elements such as drums, small sculpture animals, binoculars, and interpretive signage and provide access to inclusive play elements such as embankment slides, a basket swing, play ship, timber maze climber, and water garden, as well as provide views across Fort Point Channel. \\xa0The seating and reflection areas are designed to be inclusive and provide comfortable locations for parents and caregivers. Trails throughout the site create spaces for children to experience nature in the city and a wooden amphitheater is available for group gatherings, school events, Boston Children\\'s Museum programming, and more. The site is also heavily planted providing a green framework around the park that creates a unique horticultural experience in an urban environment. Its central location draws a high volume of residents and visitors and connects with the existing plaza at Boston Children\\'s Museum.In addition to creating a park where children and families of all abilities can play, Martin\\'s Park also helps support Boston\\'s resilience and environment goals. Last year, Mayor Walsh announced a comprehensive and transformative vision that will invest in Boston\\'s waterfront to protect the City\\'s residents, homes, jobs, and infrastructure against the impacts of rising sea level and climate change. Mayor Walsh\\'s plan,\\xa0Resilient Boston Harbor, lays out strategies along Boston\\'s 47-mile shoreline that will increase access and open space along the waterfront while better protecting the city during a major flooding event. \\xa0Martin\\'s Park will be a cornerstone of Boston\\'s work to make the city resilient to climate change and sea level rise. Protective measures against future flooding were created by raising parts of the park to prevent flood pathways, and by installing mini piles and vegetated beds reinforced with stone to prevent erosion at higher tides.Martin\\'s Park was a $15 million project, made possible by private funding through hundreds of donors and $2 million from the City of Boston, including capital funds and Community Preservation funds. The Smith Family Foundation and Barr Foundation each provided $3 million. The park site includes a parcel that was conveyed by the MBTA to the City of Boston. The park will be maintained through an endowment of the Friends of Martin\\'s Park and will feature ongoing, no-cost programming.', 'Mayor Martin J. Walsh and the Boston Parks and Recreation Department this week celebrated more than $4.7 million in improvements to Noyes Park in East Boston during a Neighborhood Coffee Hour held on Wednesday, June 12.“Noyes Park has undergone major reconstruction and we are proud to share the results of the hard work that went into this project with the East Boston community,” said Mayor Walsh. \\xa0“The new and improved Noyes Park will be a place that children and families will enjoy for many years to come, and I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this great new park to life.”Funded with a $4.7 million investment from Mayor Walsh’s Capital Plan, including a $400,000 Parkland Acquisitions and Renovations for Communities (PARC) grant and a $100,000 grant from Youth Lead the Change, site improvements include new LED sports lighting, a synthetic soccer/softball field, a fenced and irrigated baseball field with batting/pitching cage and covered player’s benches, a fenced and irrigated Little League field with scoreboard and covered player’s benches, a playground for ages 5 to 12 and 2 to 5 with rubber safety surfacing, a rope climber and dish swing, 2 to 5 play structure and tot swings, splash pad, two basketball courts, a walking loop and exercise station, new trees, and rain gardens.Noyes Playground is one of the largest playgrounds in East Boston at 8.22 acres. The park has traditionally served baseball, softball, Little League, soccer, and as a playground.\\xa0 The comprehensive renovation approach allowed the Parks Department design team to look at ways to separate uses while diversifying and providing additional uses within the park. This project was done in coordination with a tidal gate being installed by the Boston Water and Sewer Commission at Constitution Beach to stop tidal flooding from entering the site along Saratoga Street.The Neighborhood Coffee Hours give residents a unique opportunity to speak directly with Mayor Walsh and staff from City departments about open space and other needs in their neighborhoods.\\xa0 Through these discussions and a suggestion box at each site, Mayor Walsh looks forward to hearing how the City of Boston can improve upon local parks, public areas, and city services.', \"Americans for the Arts today honored two public art projects supported by the City of Boston among 50 outstanding public arts projects through the Public Art Network Year in Review program, the only national program that specifically recognizes the most compelling public art.“The City of Boston has transformed over the past several years thanks to incredible new pieces of public art,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “Through projects like our Percent for Art program, our artist-in-residence program Boston AIR, and temporary public art projects, we’re integrating art into every neighborhood of the City, and it’s great to see these efforts receive national recognition.”Chosen by public art experts, the roster of selected projects was unveiled this morning at Americans for the Arts’ Annual Convention in Minneapolis.

Three murals were painted in the Grove Hall neighborhood of Dorchester as part of this project, including:Located at the UCERM Empowerment Center at 324 Blue Hill Ave, Gibbs designed this mural to give a nod to the past in order to breathe life into the future.

According to Quiñonez, the heart in the mural represents the most important and vital organ that keeps people going, and also represents love. With Liza Quiñonez, he is a co-founder of Street Theory, a creative studio and gallery.“The best of public art can challenge, delight, educate, and illuminate. Most of all, public art creates a sense of civic vitality in the cities, towns, and communities we inhabit and visit,” said Robert L. Lynch, president and CEO of Americans for the Arts. “As these Public Art Network Year in Review selections illustrate, public art has the power to enhance our lives on a scale that little else can. I congratulate the artists and commissioning groups for these community treasures, and I look forward to honoring more great works in the years to come.”The second Boston project that was recognized, Hard in the Paint by Maria Molteni, was developed as part of her project for Boston AIR, the City of Boston’s artist-in-residence program. Molteni collaborated with youth from the BCYF Perkins after school program and peewee basketball community to draft and execute vibrant new painted designs for the Harambee Park basketball courts, neighboring the Perkins Center. Molteni aimed on centering the project on community input and narratives, and the final product was a colorful, dynamic basketball court, filled with words and images that define the Perkins community.“I think the unique success of our Hard in the Paint project, and what sets it apart from other basketball court projects I’ve seen, hinges on the fact that we were allowed to have an organic and radically open community and creative process,” said Maria Molteni. “When I work on these courts, I intentionally begin with only a loose vision so that the most appropriate piece for that space and neighborhood can develop as it will. It’s less about locking down the final product from the beginning and more about being patient, present, and flexible with a genuine and attentive artistic practice.”“These projects will serve as models for cities around the county because they exemplify the power of public art to celebrate and reflect the diversity of lived experience in the City of Boston,” said Kara Elliott-Ortega, Chief of Arts and Culture for the City of Boston.Three other projects in Boston were featured in the 2019 PAN Year in Review, including UNLESS by Stephanie Cardon in the Back Bay, Pathways to Freedom by Julia Vogl in the Boston Common, and Temple of Mnemon by Anne Lilly on the Rose Kennedy Greenway. The complete list of projects selected for Year in Review can be viewed online.Building on his Administration’s commitment to arts and culture in the City of Boston, in 2017, Americans for the Arts presented Mayor Walsh with the National Award for Local Arts Leadership for cities with a population of 100,000 or more. The award was presented as a way to recognize the accomplishments achieved over the last several years to bolstering the arts, including doubling the amount of grant money available to Boston arts organizations creating a Cabinet-level position for arts and culture creating Boston’s first cultural plan, Boston Creates establishing Boston’s artist-in-residence program and more.The Mayor's Office of Arts and Culture's mission is to support artists, the cultural sector, and to promote access to the arts for all. The office houses the Boston Cultural Council, the Boston Art Commission, and the Poet Laureate program. Responsibilities include implementing the City's cultural plan, Boston Creates commissioning public art, managing the Boston Artist-in-Residence program curating exhibitions in City Hall and operating the historic Strand Theater in Dorchester.Americans for the Arts is the leading nonprofit organization for advancing the arts and arts education in America. With offices in Washington, D.C., and New York City, it has a record of more than 55 years of service. Americans for the Arts is dedicated to representing and serving local communities and creating opportunities for every American to participate in and appreciate all forms of the arts.\", '\\xa0Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced the City of Boston\\'s Complete Count Committee, a group of cross-sector leaders that will work to ensure that all Boston residents are aware of the upcoming 2020 U.S. Census, know why it\\'s important, and are prepared to participate. Census day is April 1, 2020, starting the decennial count that determines everything from representation in Congress, to federal funds for schools, affordable housing, infrastructure and health care programs.\"We want to ensure all Bostonians are counted, because all Bostonians count,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Members of our Complete Count Committee have the expertise and knowledge in their fields, and are trusted voices in the community. Their leadership will play a vital role in our outreach efforts, and we\\'re confident that they will help us organize and mobilize Bostonians to ensure an equitable and accurate count.\"The following is a list of Boston\\'s Complete Count Committee:Mayor Walsh and Boston\\'s Complete Count Committee met this week to go over the City\\'s outreach strategy and receive assignments to one of the following subcommittees: aging and persons with disabilities, children and youth, community-based organizations, community centers, corporate and business associations, cultural institutions, faith-based organizations, government officials, health care, higher education, housing and homelessness, labor, Main Streets and neighborhood businesses, and philanthropic foundations.\"I am honored to serve on Boston\\'s Complete Count Committee and to join a diverse group of leaders charged with ensuring our hardest to reach populations, including our immigrants and people of color, are counted,\" said Boston City Council President Andrea J. Campbell. \"I look forward to exploring all available tools so that our City and all Bostonians ultimately receive the resources they are due.\"\"I am honored to sit on of the City of Boston\\'s Complete Count Committee. The census represents an opportunity for our communities to work towards closing inequitable disparities,\" said Rep. Chynah Tyler. \"With an accurate census count, we can ensure that the federal, state, and local governments provide the adequate amount of assistance to address all issue areas facing Bostonians, especially our most vulnerable.\"\"Religious communities know the worth of every person. We\\'re excited to work with the City to ensure a complete count of every Bostonian,\" said Rev. Laura E. Everett, Executive Director, Massachusetts Council of Churches.In April 2019, Mayor Walsh, nonprofit leaders and community members\\xa0launched a year-long outreach campaign to ensure a fair and complete count in the 2020 U.S. Census, where he announced the City is investing an additional $100,000 in his FY20 budget to support Boston\\'s outreach efforts by providing grants to community-based organizations and more support to City departments. This is in addition to a FY19 investment of dedicated staffing resources to support the City\\'s census efforts announced in the Mayor\\'s 2019 State of the City address. \\xa0Next year\\'s Census faces unprecedented challenges, including significant underfunding of the U.S. Census Bureau, the nearly all-digital nature of the surveys, and the possible inclusion of a citizenship question on which the Supreme Court will soon issue a ruling on. Boston Counts 2020 is the City\\'s effort to support an equitable and complete count in the next U.S. Census, and the Committee will work to ensure every resident in Boston is counted.Data from the 2010 Census determine around $16 billion every year in federal spending for critical programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, affordable housing initiatives, Title I education funding, and infrastructure in Massachusetts. For every one person that\\'s not counted on the Census, the state loses out on roughly $2,400 of federal funding.Despite the amount of federal resources at stake, there are multiple hard-to-count populations that reside in Massachusetts that historically have made a complete census count difficult. This is due in part to the state\\'s population of recent immigrants, renters, college students, and other hard-to-count populations. Boston is the ninth hardest-to-count city among the largest 100 cities nationwide, according to a\\xa0recent report\\xa0by Boston Indicators and the Boston Foundation.For more information on the City\\'s outreach efforts to ensure a fair and complete count, please visit\\xa0boston.gov/2020-census.', 'The Bunker Hill Day Parade, the Adidas Boost Games and other special events taking place this weekend will impact traffic and parking in Boston.\\xa0 People coming into the City to attend are encouraged not to drive their personal vehicles. \\xa0Information on Bluebikes, the regional bike share service, may be found at http://bluebikes.com and information on the MBTA may be found at www.mbta.com.

Walsh and Councilor Josh Zakim today announced amendments to the \"Boston Trust Act,\" a City ordinance that delineates the work of local law enforcement officials and federal immigration laws. Originally passed unanimously by the City Council and signed into law by Mayor Walsh in 2014, the updated ordinance furthers its original intent of ensuring immigrant integration and advancement by reassuring that local authorities shall not detain someone solely on civil immigration detainer requests or administrative warrants, and shall not transfer someone to immigration authorities unless ordered by judicial authorities.\"At a time when our federal government keeps drafting cruel policy changes targeting immigrants, in Boston we solely believe in keeping families together and providing them with opportunities so they can fully live their lives,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Our Boston Police Department has done a notable job in abiding by the Trust Act, but changes in the law and the national rhetoric has made it necessary for us to update the original ordinance. This updated Trust Act further clarifies the roles of our officers, while keeping our residents\\' safety as the main goal. I thank Councilor Zakim for his collaboration and thorough review of the ordinance.\"\"Passing the Trust Act in 2014 was a proud moment for the City of Boston,\" Councilor Josh Zakim said. \"In the 5 years since, immigrants have been scapegoated and attacked by so-called leaders in this country. These updates to the Trust Act that Mayor Walsh and I are announcing today, are an example of how Boston continues to stand up for our values. Our City\\'s resources and law enforcement personnel should be used to protect Bostonians, not to enforce failed federal immigration policy. I look forward to working with Mayor Walsh, my colleagues on the Council, and advocates in the community to enact these amendments swiftly.\"A civil immigration detainer request is a request by federal immigration officers to local law enforcement officials to maintain custody of someone and advise federal officials prior to their release. Since the signing of the Boston Trust Act, the Boston Police Department has submitted a report to the City Clerk with the number of civil immigration detainer requests received the number of individuals that City law enforcement officials detained the number of individuals transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and the total cost reimbursements received from the federal government.Reports from the Boston Police Department show that in 2017 and 2018, ICE lodged 68 and 107 civil immigration detainer requests respectively, which all were given access to bail by BPD and were not transferred to ICE custody. Those that did not post bail were transported to the court for arraignment, moving out of BPD\\'s authority. The updated ordinance keeps requiring the department to report this information, including the reasons for civil immigration detainer requests.The Boston Trust Act preceded the\\xa0Lunn v. Commonwealth\\xa0case where the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Massachusetts and its municipalities do not have the authority under state law to honor civil immigration detainer requests. The updated Boston Trust Act maintains its main clause: local law enforcement shall not detain a person solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer request issued by a federal immigration officer, or an administrative warrant issued by a federal immigration officer.The Boston Trust Act codifies that local law enforcement officials enforce state laws and local ordinances. Further clarifying their roles with federal immigration laws, the updated Boston Trust Act directs that City and department personnel and funds shall not be used to interrogate, detain, or arrest persons solely for immigration enforcement purposes, which are federal responsibilities, including:The ordinance builds on Boston\\'s immigrant advancement work and its efforts to mitigate the impact of federal immigration restrictions on the City\\'s immigrants. Since the start of the Trump\\'s Administration reform on the immigration system, Mayor Walsh has been opposed to proposed changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), the proposed redefinition of \"public charge,\" and HUD\\'s proposed rule to expel from public housing mixed-status families paying prorated rent.Mayor Walsh recently included $50,000 in his\\xa0FY20 Budget proposal\\xa0dedicated to the Greater Boston Immigrant Defense Fund, a public-private partnership that works to increase education and access to legal services to defend its many immigrant communities, refugees, and temporary status holders. Originally designed as a two-year pilot, the Fund demonstrated that Boston residents make up the largest percentage of the cases opened among the 38 cities and towns served by the Defense Fund. City funds included in the FY20 Budget will jumpstart the third year of the Fund.For more information on Boston\\'s immigration work, please visit the Immigrant Advancement website.', \"Thank you to everyone who participated in the 2019 Awards,\\xa0either through promoting the program, nominating friends and colleagues, or voting for the finalists.

Walsh yesterday joined the City of Boston Scholarship Committee at the Suffolk Construction Headquarters in Roxbury to award 32 Boston students up to $10,000 in scholarships to help fund their higher education. Over 120 students currently receive an annual scholarship of $2,500 through the fund for the duration of their undergraduate education. In total, the fund will distribute almost $300,000 in scholarships this year, making college more accessible for Boston residents.\"I want to congratulate all the scholarship recipients on receiving this well-deserved honor,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Each of these students represent what it means to be a Bostonian -- working hard, always learning, and never giving up. I am incredibly proud of these students\\' accomplishments and can\\'t wait to see how they leave their mark on the world.\"The City of Boston Scholarship Fund was established in 1994 to provide assistance to residents who plan to pursue a two- or four-year undergraduate program in Massachusetts. Applicants must be residents of Boston and must have graduated from high school by the time the awards are made in June.\"I would love to thank the City of Boston for this scholarship, it means so much to me. Receiving this scholarship makes me even more motivated and encouraged to continue to be a student leader and activist when I get to college because I know that my hard work is being recognized! In addition, college is very expensive, so earning this scholarship helps me a lot financially,\" said Stanley Aneke, a 2019 City of Boston Scholar who will be attending the University of Massachusetts-Amherst this fall.Funds for the scholarships are made possible from contributions made by residents and corporations. This year\\'s scholarships were supported by generous donations from Arbella Insurance Foundation, Jonathan and Margot Davis, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Herb Chambers Foundation, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Lewis Family Foundation, Santander, and Rapid7 as part of their ongoing commitment to Boston\\'s students.Among the 32 City of Boston Scholars this year, 24 are high school seniors, five are current college students and three are adult learners returning to school to finish their degrees. A profile of the 2019 City of Boston Scholars is included below:The City of Boston Scholarship Committee has awarded over 950 students scholarships since 1995. This year, the Scholarship Fund celebrated the seventeenth year of an endowed scholarship donated by the Rosen Family in memory of Jeffrey Dunipace Rosen. The Fund celebrated the fourth year of the Community Development Scholarship, established in remembrance of Mayor Thomas M. Menino, and a Community Spirit Scholarship in memory of former public servant and City of Boston Scholarship awardee, Dawn Jaffier.This year\\'s scholarship awards strengthen the post-secondary access initiatives that Mayor Walsh has launched or supported over the last year, including the\\xa0GRAD (Graduate Ready to Achieve Degree) Last Mile Fund, \\xa0Free Community College Tuition,\\xa0Boston Bridge,\\xa0Boston Saves, and ongoing support activities for students through the\\xa0Success Boston partnership.Yesterday\\'s announcement builds on the Mayor\\'s commitment to expanding access to higher education for Boston residents. Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh announced the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology (BFIT) will be the first private college to participate in Boston\\'s Tuition-Free Community College Plan. Launched by Mayor Walsh in 2016, Boston\\'s Tuition-Free Community College program makes college more affordable for Boston residents who have earned their high school credential. BFIT joins Roxbury Community College, Bunker Hill Community College, and MassBay Community College as a participant in the program.Included in Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa02019 legislative agenda\\xa0is \"An Act Establishing Tuition Free Community College in Massachusetts (House Bill 1245),\" filed by Representative Chynah Tyler.

The lane will be active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and bicycles will be welcome to share the lane with MBTA and school buses. Installation of the lane will start on Wednesday.\"I am proud that by working collaboratively with residents in the Allston/Brighton community, we are able to dedicate a bus lane on Brighton Avenue that will improve commute times, reduce congestion and reduce emissions from motor vehicles in the neighborhood,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This new bus lane is an important step forward in our efforts to improve public transportation and make it safer and more reliable for users.\"Improving bus service is a stated goal of\\xa0Go Boston 2030, the City of Boston\\'s long-term transportation plan, with Brighton Avenue, between Cambridge Street and Commonwealth Avenue, being identified as a priority corridor. More than 14,000 MBTA bus passengers travel along this stretch each day, and the street is used by Boston Public School buses as well.The MBTA is providing financial support for design and implementation of the bus lane, while the Mayor\\'s budget calls for investing $200,000 annually for maintenance of designated bus lanes in the City of Boston. The MBTA will also assist in the enforcement of the bus lane, and will collaborate with BTD to monitor the lane\\'s effectiveness. As a second phase of the Brighton Avenue project, the City will partner with the MBTA to look at other bus service improvements for the corridor this fall. BTD will also explore updating traffic signals to give priority to buses, as well as bumping out the curb at bus stops, so buses will not need to leave the bus lane to allow passengers on and off.\"This is great news for riders of the Routes 57 and 66, and it reinforces our commitment to partner with Boston and other communities to improve transit services for those who are dependent upon it,\" said MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak. \"Our Capital Investment Program has dedicated $9 million to fund bus lanes and other improvements for approximately fourteen miles of high volume bus corridors in and around Boston.\"The launch of this lane has been supported by community partners including Allston Main Streets, the Allston-Brighton Health Collaborative, and LivableStreets Alliance. These groups have been instrumental in collecting feedback on bus service from riders and community members, as well as collaborating with the City on the final design of the lane.Anna Leslie, MPH, Director of the Allston Brighton Health Collaborative said, \"Since Winter 2018, the Allston Brighton Health Collaborative has worked closely with Livable Streets Alliance and Allston Village Main Streets to demonstrate the broad neighborhood support for safer and more efficient mobility on Brighton Ave. We know that accessible transportation for all is essential for any healthy community and our Transportation Committee is so pleased with the bus/bike lane outcome. We are so appreciative to the BTD Transit Team for prioritizing this corridor and thinking creatively, and we look forward to continued and successful partnership.\"The Boston Transportation Department\\'s newly-formed Transit Team, created under the leadership of Mayor Walsh, has engaged in a robust stakeholder engagement process to prepare for the installation of this lane. The team has connected with community organizations in the area and visited all businesses along the eastbound side of Brighton Avenue. In addition, the Transit Team has launched\\xa0a project page\\xa0for the bus lane on the City\\'s website.In addition to the new bus/bike lane, two new zones are being established in Brighton Avenue at Harvard Avenue and Linden Street for daytime commercial loading and evening pick up/drop off. Flexible curb space on Brighton Avenue will help reduce double parking, provide space for rideshare vehicle pick up/drop off, and support access to businesses.The Brighton Avenue bus lane follows the success of the permanent bus lane that the City installed in 2018 on Washington Street, inbound from Roslindale Village to the Forest Hills Station. The Washington Street bus lane received strong support from Roslindale residents, bus riders, and cyclists. MBTA data has confirmed that riders have benefited from the bus lane.After the installation of the lane, travel time was reduced by 20 to 25 percent during the hours of highest congestion (7:30 AM to 8:30 AM). In a survey of bus riders and bicyclists on Washington Street, 94 percent supported a permanent bus and bicycle lane. Of the bus passengers, 92 percent perceived that the bus lane decreased their travel time. Of the bicyclists, 89 percent reported feeling safer in the shared lane. In addition, morning peak period daily ridership along Washington Street increased by 158 passengers following the installation of the bus lane.This launch of the Brighton Avenue bus lane is part of a collaborative effort by the \\xa0City and the MBTA to expand transit infrastructure and improve rider experience throughout Boston.

In the ruling, MassDEP determined that Boston\\'s proposal meets the performance standards under the Wetlands Protection Act and minimizes impacts to coastal wetland resources in both Boston and Quincy.\"Our efforts to create a regional recovery campus on Long Island have always been guided by our fundamental belief that every person deserves a chance at recovery,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"The opioid crisis we\\'re living goes beyond city lines, and we welcome everyone\\'s support as we take action to help those suffering find their path to a better life.

Mayor Walsh then pledged in his 2018 inaugural address to rebuild it and create a comprehensive, long-term recovery campus on Long Island.City of Boston engineers and consultants have determined that rebuilding the bridge is necessary for day-to-day operations and emergency service to and from Long Island, presenting publicly on the plan over the last year, including at the Boston Conservation Commission, the Quincy Conservation Commission, and community meetings in both cities.The bridge will have an estimated 75-year lifespan and will be reconstructed by rehabilitating the existing piers and placing a new superstructure, along with improving access to the roadways on both Moon Island and Long Island.\\xa0After examining a ferry service, City of Boston engineers and consultants determined that this is not an adequate option given the environmental impact, cost, and typical timeline for implementation, and more importantly, the inability of a ferry to support the required public safety services for a public health campus.The City of Boston is planning an innovative and holistic recovery campus on Long Island that will expand essential recovery services for the region, fill gaps in the continuum of care and utilize the natural environment to provide a healing space. The City has contracted with Gensler and Ascension Recovery Services to identify the types of services, resources and treatment options that would be best suited for the island and create a master plan for the recovery campus.Having been in recovery for over 20 years, Mayor Walsh understands firsthand how easily addiction can take hold and how difficult it can be to recover. In his first term, Mayor Walsh made expanding access to recovery services in Boston a priority by creating the\\xa0Office of Recovery Services\\xa0to study substance use in Boston and lead the city\\'s strategy around substance use disorders, addiction and recovery. This is the first municipal recovery office in the nation.The City has taken a comprehensive approach to tackle the opioid epidemic, serving people in all stages of the continuum of care, from providing harm reduction services to ensure people can maintain health in various aspects of their lives, to connecting people with beds at rehabilitation facilities, to offering inpatient and outpatient programming, to long-term peer support for those further along in their recovery journey.Continuing these efforts, the City of Boston\\xa0filed a complaint\\xa0in Suffolk Superior Court against 13 opioid manufacturers, four distributors, and one local doctor that have contributed to the local opioid epidemic through misleading marketing and reckless dissemination of opioids that has led to the\\xa0deaths of more than 830 Boston residents since 2014.\\xa0As part of the litigation, the City is seeking to recover both past and future damages and injunctive relief associated with addressing the opioid epidemic in Boston.', 'Building on his commitment to build more affordable housing in the City of Boston, Mayor Martin J.

We are so proud of this project and of the commitment of this community whose support has been instrumental, particularly through the rebuilding process.\"The development for this new building was made possible in part by investments from the City of Boston the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development Boston Private Bank and RBC Capital Markets. Additionally, the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation played a crucial role in the completion of the Treadmark project.The ribbon cutting of Treadmark marks a major milestone in the continued growth of Ashmont/ Peabody Square following a lengthy process of recovery after a 2017 construction fire. Dedication to the neighborhood led to the commitment to immediately rebuild. In addition to these 83 new units of housing, the City has added more than 200 units of housing to the area. \\xa0\"Treadmark highlights our long-standing commitment to community investment, and we are pleased to be a key financing source for this type of mixed-used, mixed-income project that will benefit this neighborhood for generations to come,\" said Esther Schlorholtz, director of community investment, Boston Private Bank.\"Treadmark exemplifies what can be done through strong public-private partnerships and targeted investments.

As the two chatted in Portuguese, her client, Lucas*, mentioned that a company was helping him fix his credit score.“Are you paying them for that?” Paterlini asked. “Yes, about $800 a month,” he replied. \\xa0Paterlini was immediately suspicious. Lucas was a recent immigrant who was still learning how the tax, credit, and lending systems worked in the U.S. He also did not speak much English. She knew that Lucas would be a prime target for predatory finance schemes. Paterlini referred Lucas to her colleague, Jose Rodriguez, who is a multilingual financial coach with the Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE). \\xa0Jose walked Lucas through a free Financial Check-Up. The Check-Up, which was conducted in Spanish, included a personalized financial assessment and credit score review. Jose then helped Lucas come up with a plan to rebuild his credit without the help of the “credit-fixing” company.Lucas managed to clear his credit in eight months. The following year, when Lucas went to file his taxes, he nearly cried when he saw how much he would be getting back. He had had no idea that his cleared credit would impact his tax returns so much. His return increased about 1,200% from $600 to $8,000. This happy ending to Lucas’ story was made possible because the Boston Tax Help Coalition (BTHC) has spent the last 15 years developing fully-inclusive programming. \\xa0As part of the Office of Financial Empowerment, they provide free financial coaching to Boston residents. During the tax season, the Coalition’s accessibility practice has made it possible for anyone who uses another language or communicates in an alternative way to access free tax and asset-building services and get referrals for long-term assistance. This has had huge implications for advancing equity in communities that have traditionally had less access to resources and opportunities for financial empowerment. “Integrative and collaborative programming is hard work, but it is a critical part of what we do because this is what an inclusive city can look like,” says Mimi Turchinetz, Director of the Boston Tax Help Coalition. While accessibility planning does not happen overnight, Turchinetz and her team have been persistent in refining their services to be as inclusive as possible. For example, BTHC hires nine part-time Ambassadors who lead outreach efforts across various immigrant and disability communities within Boston. Ambassadors are multilingual community leaders who are fluent in English and at least one other language: American Sign Language (ASL), Arabic, Cabo\\xa0Verdean Creole, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. They play an important role in educating clients, helping with tax returns, and building trust in their communities.The organization also recruits and trains about 400 volunteers per year, some of whom are fluent in other languages besides English. Volunteers help clients file taxes and some are available to provide interpretation services at more than 30\\xa0tax sites all over Boston. \\xa0\\xa0In addition to supporting language accessibility, BTHC has been a leader in integrating their services with the needs of the disability community. They have evaluated all their partner tax sites for ADA compliance and run regular training for staff and volunteers on best practices when communicating with individuals with disabilities. BTHC also organizes American Sign Language (ASL) Tax Days in partnership with the Mayor’s Disabilities Commission and Deaf Inc., a Boston-based nonprofit that serves individuals who are Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Deaf Blind. These tax days are designed to accommodate people across diverse needs and communications preferences. A number of ASL hearing interpreters and Deaf interpreters are hired to make these tax days possible. This year’s sessions helped around 100 people file their tax returns and receive Financial Check-Ups.The Coalition’s language and communications accessible programming makes it possible for thousands of Boston residents to access free asset-building services like tax preparation help, Financial Check-Ups, credit-building, one-on-one finance and career coaching, and much more. And when it comes to the impact of the organization, Paterlini says it best: “We do so much more than offer tax help in other languages or translate materials. We help people rebuild their lives.” The Boston Tax Help Coalition is a public-private partnership managed by the Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment. In 2018, the organization helped nearly 13,000 low- and middle-income taxpayers recover approximately $33 million dollars in refunds and credits. The 2019 tax season was the Coalition’s 18th year providing free tax preparation services for Boston residents and there are no plans of slowing down. *Lucas’ name has been changed to protect their identity.The Office of Language and Communication Access works to strengthen the City of Boston so that services, programs and activities are meaningfully accessible to all constituents.

O\\'Hanley, president & CEO of State Street and co-chair of the upcoming inaugural gala event for the Fund. \"It is imperative that both the public and private sectors provide the resources needed to continue - and improve - the important educational, civic, and cultural services the Boston Public Library makes available to the people of Boston and the Commonwealth. The Fund for the Boston Public Library builds on the tradition established at the very founding of the Boston Public Library and creates the opportunity for all of us - the private sector, corporate and foundation support, and individuals alike - to contribute to the Boston Public Library\\'s mission.\"The City of Boston provides significant resources to the Library - including a $127 million investment from Mayor Walsh\\'s\\xa0FY20-24 Capital Plan\\xa0which includes funding for the construction of a new Adams Street Branch of the Boston Public Library, the renovation of the Roslindale branch, and programming studies for the West End and Codman Square branches. It also includes funding for the completion of the renovation of the Dudley branch and the programming study for a new Fields Corner branch, and a renovation project at the Central Library to enhance preservation of historic special collections of rare books and manuscripts.Mayor Walsh noted that additional resources are needed to operate the Library at the highest level possible to benefit the public. To raise the needed resources, Mayor Walsh and the Boston Public Library\\'s Board of Trustees have charged the Fund with focusing on four strategic areas:\"As we look to bridge the equity gaps and digital divides that challenge our city, the Boston Public Library system - from its majestic McKim and dynamic Johnson buildings to its 25 branches throughout Boston - serves as an important part of our civic infrastructure, increasing equity in each community as it provides high-quality educational, social, and cultural enrichment for free to the public,\" said Jeff Hawkins, the new Chair of the Fund, \"The Fund will sustain and preserve for future generations the Library\\'s role as one of Boston\\'s major cultural and educational institutions.\"An inaugural fundraising gala event co-hosted by the Fund and the Norman B.

Walsh and the Department of Neighborhood Development today announced that since the inception of the\\xa0Boston\\'s Way Home\\xa0plan to end chronic and veteran homelessness, the City of Boston has housed more than 1,000 homeless veterans. \\xa0Over the past five years, the City has transformed its system so that every homeless veteran in Boston has access to shelter and a path to permanent housing. The City provides immediate shelter to any veteran sleeping on the street who wants it. As a result, Boston has the lowest rate of unsheltered homelessness of any major U.S. city, as well as one of the lowest rates of unsheltered veteran homelessness nationally.\"Our goal is to ensure that everyone in Boston has a place to call home,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"We are proud of the work our teams have done in ending homelessness among chronically homeless veterans, but there is still work to be done. This milestone shows our continued dedication to housing all veterans in the City who are in need.\"In 2016, the City was certified as having ended chronic homelessness among veterans.\\xa0People who are chronically homeless have experienced homelessness for at least a year - or repeatedly - while struggling with a condition such as a serious mental illness, substance use disorder, or physical disability.\\xa0The City is continuing to work towards ending all veteran homelessness in the City of Boston.\"Housing over 1,000 veterans is a huge accomplishment,\" said Boston\\'s Commissioner of Veterans Services, Robert Santiago. \"This milestone shows that the Mayor\\'s commitment to end homelessness among veterans continues to be a top priority. We strive to ensure all veterans experiencing homelessness in Boston have a path to permanent housing. Our office works to ensure veterans in the City of Boston are always supported -- whether that\\'s mental health services, job opportunities, or vital housing supports.\"\\xa0The Boston\\'s Way Home plan has resulted in a complete redesign of the way Boston offers services to homeless individuals. As part of Boston\\'s plan, the City is committed to a \"Housing First\" approach to homelessness. This approach is founded on the idea that everyone should have access to permanent housing without conditions such as sobriety, treatment, or participation in services. In this model, an individual\\'s entrance into the shelter system is also their entrance to a path toward permanent, stable housing.\"The New England Center and Home for Veterans is honored to be part of the Boston Homes for the Brave Team,\" said \\xa0Andrew McCawley, President and CEO of The New England Center and Home for Veterans. \"Mayor Walsh\\'s leadership and the City\\'s close coordination of all the contributing organizations have made a real difference in the lives of veterans here in Boston. Over 1,000 veterans housed is a very impressive number, but what is most meaningful is the independence and dignity that this work returns to veterans.\"Veterans experiencing homelessness are on average 52 years old, and the majority are male. Many of these veterans \\xa0served during the Vietnam War era, followed by Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The City serves veterans whose first year of service goes back to 1948, but have also seen veterans who have served as recently as 2013.Veterans experiencing homelessness are housed through the work of the Department of Neighborhood Development working with a number of different City agencies, partner agencies and nonprofits. These agencies work together to identify every homeless veteran by name, and work one-on-one with the veterans to help them find housing resources in the Greater Boston area. Once housed, the organizations follow up with the veterans to ensure that they are able to remain in their units safely and securely.Housing opportunities for veterans are made available from a number of different places, including through the Coordinated Access System, the City\\'s automated method of connecting Continuum of Care resources, available to the veterans with the greatest need. These can take the form of mobile vouchers or opportunities to move into existing affordable units. Other veterans receive U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) vouchers from the VA and the Boston Housing Authority which allow them to find their own apartments around Greater Boston. There are also some HUD-VASH programs that have existing units where resources are available to provide long term rental assistance and stabilization services. Veterans Welcome Home is another long term stabilization program that the City funds to provide both housing search and support services to the vets in greatest need. \\xa0Many veterans also receive assistance from Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF). SSVF assists veterans in shelters around the city with many services, including housing search, and provides them with short term rental assistance when they move into their new units.Creating new permanent supportive housing is an important component of the City\\'s plan to end chronic homelessness, in that it combines subsidized rental housing with individualized support services so that people with complex health issues can receive the assistance they need to stay housed. The services are designed to build independent living skills and to connect people with services such as community-based health care, help with mental health issues, substance use counseling, and employment services.To aid in the effort to end homelessness in Boston, in 2018, Mayor Walsh announced the launch of\\xa0Boston\\'s Way Home Fund,\\xa0which has a goal of raising more than $10 million over a four year period to create 200 new units of supportive, sustainable, long-term housing for chronically homeless men and women. After one year, the fund has raised more than $6 million to support this effort.', 'Building on his commitment to build more affordable housing and end chronic homeslessness in the City of Boston, Mayor Martin J.

And after an April where it felt like the rain wouldn’t stop, we’re excited to finally leave City Hall and feel a little warmth during the day. With the shifting in seasons, we wanted to highlight some of the great late spring and summer content being produced by departments across the City.What would a summer highlights blog post be without plugging our Summer in Boston guide page? In our guide, you can find popular parks and playgrounds, as well as maps of pools, tot sprays, and public restrooms in the City.As part of our update for summer 2019, we went through and added all of the Parks Department’s ParkARTS events to the site. This program brings culture and the arts to Boston’s parks throughout the summer. ParkARTS has a little something for everyone. For families, we have puppet shows, artist workshops for kids, and even movie nights. If you like music, there are plenty of concerts to enjoy under the stars. Check out the ParkARTS page to learn more.Aside from arts events, the Parks Department is also overflowing with sports and activities for kids and teens ages 6 - 18, including:They even run a six-week, full-day program starting in July that teaches kids the fundamentals of sports.

Don’t forget to register!Nothing says spring at the City of Boston like the release of the Mayor’s recommended budget for the upcoming fiscal year, when we're all thinking about new projects with a fresh focus. We’ve been hosting the budget on Boston.gov for a couple of years now, but previous iterations of the site took a lot of work to create. We were relying on data flowing in from outside of Drupal to populate tables, and the process of updating and creating pages through Markdown and GitHub was more complicated than it needed to be.With one of our talented product managers spearheading the project, we fully integrated the FY20 Budget website into Drupal. Taking advantage of an open-sourced tool called Vega, we were able to create interactive, easy-to-build graphics for the numbers behind the budget. And thanks to some user research performed by a talented group from General Assembly, we made changes to our content and layout to make it easier for users to digest the information.Another positive benefit to this project was that, after some Drupal training, Budget Department staff were able to jump in and create and edit pages on their own. With fewer, more organized pages about budget facts, figures, and highlights, it made their efforts to provide this information in plain language even easier.Each year in May for Preservation Month, the Landmarks Commission promotes events that encourage public awareness and appreciation of the City's historic resources. To help in their efforts, we added more than 100 events to the City calendar for this year’s celebration. There’s still plenty to do for the month of May. Make sure you check out the Preservation Month page.The City of Boston has been making a huge effort to create an inclusive, positive work environment for City employees. As part of that ongoing effort, the City has established Employee Resource Groups to connect coworkers around shared interests.

Working with the program director, we were able to successfully migrate and move all of the content from a micro-site to our official City site.

Because of the stigma associated with mental illness, many people are too ashamed or embarrassed to seek the help they need for themselves or their loved ones.During this week’s Council meeting, the Council adopted a resolution offered by Councilor Essaibi-George, recognizing May as Mental Health Awareness Month in Boston.Since 1949, May has been recognized as Mental Health Awareness Month, with the intended purpose of raising awareness, fighting stigma, providing support, educating the public, and advocating for policies that support people with mental illness.\"Erasing stigma enables us to further educate one another and all our loved ones on warning signs and symptoms, and normalize seeking help,\" said Councilor Essaibi-George. \"Mental Health Awareness Month is a time to work together to break through that stigma and express compassion for those who struggle with mental health issues, so that they can help change their lives for the better.\"', 'In the course \"AR 410: Archaeological Research Design and Materials Analysis,\" taught by Professor Catherine West and Teaching Fellow Kathleen Forste, eleven BU students spent the semester analyzing artifacts spanning the 17th-\\xa019th centuries, such as ceramics, animal bones, smoking pipes, toys, buttons, and coins. The goal was to understand the identity, social and economic class, and everyday activities of inhabitants of the Pierce-Hichborn House.As part of their work, they were asked to write blog posts below to reflect on their analysis and interpretations of these objects that were once used by historic Bostonians. To see some of the artifacts and their interpretations, visit the Boston City Archaeologist Instagram page and search for hashtags #digPHH and #BUArchTakeOver.It\\'s a rainy day in the mid-18th\\xa0century. You\\'re hosting your neighbors for tea time to show off the new tea set you just purchased. It’s a complete Chinese porcelain set and it cost you a pretty penny. You’ve just discarded your old Staffordshire slipware set into the privy in the back, and all of your neighbors are trying to hide their jealousy…Ceramic tea wares and tablewares were a way to express status and affluence in historic New England. Upper middle-class families took great pride in their service wares. There was significant importance in the material and completeness of tea sets, as it portrayed one’s family as refined and sophisticated, showing the family’s social standing. \\xa0The Pierce-Hichborn House, located in the North End of Boston, was occupied by a number of varying income families from the 17th through the early 20th century. During an excavation in spring 2018, the Boston City Archaeologist discovered many sherds — or broken pieces — of ceramics similar to the ones described in the scene above. Some of the ceramics found included Chinese and English porcelain, stoneware, creamware, and many other types.\\xa0This may seem strange, but in today’s society we do the exact same thing, only we express it in different ways. Cell phones, for instance, are a sign of wealth — and are even disposable. People purchase the newest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy because it is a significant status symbol. It is not uncommon for wealthier people to invest their money in the newest most expensive phone, and yet there are still people that buy flip phones. What do you think archaeologists will study in 500 years as a sign of status and prestige?When you accidentally drop a pen cap on the ground and can’t be bothered to pick it up, you might not realize that in the future this very pen cap could end up in an archaeological lab, analyzed for its purpose, and for your identity. Mundane things such as a pen cap, coins, or buttons are valuable clues for archaeologists who seek to understand broader cultural factors like economics, aesthetics, and identity.During research on artifacts found in the privy of the Pierce-Hichborn House in the North End, we developed a better understanding of who the inhabitants were and of the fascinating stories that make up their lives, such as how a soccer-ball sized piece of Caribbean coral ended up in a Boston privy. Although our modern day material culture differs from that of the past, one truth persists: we represent ourselves through the objects we collect and own, whether consciously or unconsciously.This research has led us to think deeply about what we own and how it reflects our identity. Look around you and take note of all the things you have come to call your own, even things like that well-used plastic water bottle you take everywhere with you, or that little gold earring you’ve owned for years. In 200 years, how will archaeologists interpret your stories through the things you leave behind?Feature 7 from the Pierce-Hichborn House in Boston’s North End was made up of artifacts that were as fragmented and difficult to interpret as the stratigraphy of the feature itself. In looking at the artifacts from the feature, which ranged from the 17th to the 20th centuries, we were interested in those that specifically related to children, whose presence is sometimes invisible in the archaeological record.During our analysis, we found objects that are often associated with kids: toys, marbles, miniature tea sets, and slate pencils. But are these always just children’s toys, or could it be that adults were using or saving them too?\\xa0Historically, marbles are known to have been used by children and adults for gaming.\\xa0 Like some adults and children today, some people may have also collected marbles for decorative objects. \\xa0Miniature vessels, such as those found in doll tea sets, can also be connected to both children and adults.

Walsh, the Mayor\\'s Office of New Urban Mechanics, the Boston Transportation Department, in partnership with The National Safety Council, Liberty Mutual Insurance, and Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT), yesterday announced the launch of the\\xa0Boston\\'s Safest Driver Competition, a competition to encourage better driving habits. This competition supports the work of\\xa0Vision Zero, Boston\\'s commitment to focus its resources on\\xa0proven strategies to eliminate fatal and serious traffic crashes in the City by 2030.An effort of the City\\'s Vision Zero Task Force, this competition uses a\\xa0smartphone-based app\\xa0to score drivers on their behaviors and enable moments of self-reflection. Drivers from the Boston metro area are invited to compete for over $25,000 in prizes by downloading the app and practicing safe driving on the roads.\\xa0Participants can download the app today and begin to compete for the grand prizes of $5,000 each before the July 28th conclusion.\"To achieve our Vision Zero goals, we need to work together as a community to change the culture of our streets,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Boston\\'s Safest Driver competition helps us have this conversation in a fun, innovative way. I invite all drivers in the Boston area to join this competition, and be part of the solution to make our streets safer for all.\" \\xa0In 2016, the City launched the Boston\\'s Safest Driver competition, the first of its kind in the nation.\\xa0For the most active users of the app, the competition resulted in phone distraction scores improved by 47 percent, hard braking scores by 37 percent, and speeding scores by 35 percent.Since 2016, the program has been replicated in Seattle, San Antonio, Rhode Island, and Oregon. This is one tool the City of Boston has used to deliver on safer roadways for residents, a core goal of\\xa0Go Boston 2030, Boston\\'s long-term transportation plan. Since 2016 the City has lowered the default speed limit to 25 miles per hour, initiated 12 neighborhood slow streets projects, and implemented street redesigns to slow speeding vehicles and improve safety. This year\\'s competition is supported with a\\xa0Road to Zero\\xa0grant from the National Safety Council and prizes are furnished by Liberty Mutual Insurance.\"Liberty Mutual is proud to partner with the City of Boston to help reduce dangers on our roads,\" said Nicholas Grant, vice president, product management Global Retail Markets at Liberty Mutual Insurance. \"Even a quick glance away from the road while using your phone or multi-tasking can result in a dangerous situation. Raising awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and providing incentives to be safer can play a key role in helping to change driver behavior.\"During the Boston\\'s Safest Driver competition, participants can challenge friends, see how they rank in their community, and win prizes in a wide variety of categories on a biweekly basis. The person crowned City of Boston\\'s Safest Driver will win an overall grand prize of $5,000. An additional $5,000 Safest Driver grand prize will be awarded to a Metro Boston winner, grand prizes for Least Distracted and \"Slow & Steady\" driver will also be awarded. In addition to the general competition, open to all Metro Boston residents, the City is partnering with local Transportation Management Associations (TMAs) including A Better City TMA, MASCO, and Seaport TMA for a corporate challenge. The competition will be administered by Promosis, a Boston area based promotion marketing firm and independent judging organization.\"We strongly believe that traffic injuries and deaths can be drastically reduced if drivers simply paid attention to the road and slowed down. We need to bring empathy and respect back to the road, and understand that our cars are not our offices or our safe spaces, but a large piece of machinery.\" said Emily Stein, President of the Safe Roads Alliance. \"We love the Boston\\'s Safest Driver app, and think it\\'s a great tool to make drivers more aware of the number of times they might check their phone while driving, and where they tend to speed on their commute home.\"The Boston\\'s Safest Driver app, developed by Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT), provides helpful feedback on the participant\\'s driving based upon five metrics: speed, acceleration, braking, cornering, and phone distraction.\\xa0The app logs trips while in the background on the user\\'s phone, and the driver is alerted afterwards of their score for that trip, told how they did on the different factors, and provided with helpful tips to improve in the future. A goal of the competition is to allow participants to reflect on their driving behaviors and develop new safety habits.\"CMT is proud to continue working with the city of Boston and Liberty Mutual to make Boston\\'s roads safer,\" said William Powers, CMT\\'s co-founder and chief executive officer. \"We have seen how a reduction in behaviors like distracted driving can protect drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.

We thank the House and Senate for passing it, as well as the coalitions that led the effort to make this a reality.Simply put, lifting the cap provides vital resources for Boston’s most vulnerable families. It repeals a policy that denies resources for children conceived while, or soon after, a family receives benefits. It will provide a clearer path to economic stability for thousands of residents. It should also mark the beginning of a broader set of policy changes that build a social safety net rooted in dignity and support upward economic mobility and wealth-building.Lifting the Cap on Kids was one of several Economic Mobility bills on the Mayor’s Legislative Agenda that would represent significant progress towards that goal. Here, we will highlight three that focus on core elements of the social safety net:As changes to federal policy have made it more difficult for families to get ahead, Massachusetts has the opportunity to take the lead in building a system that provides solid pathways to economic security and the middle class.This opportunity is especially important to us at the Economic Mobility Lab. \\xa0We’re a team of social entrepreneurs in Mayor Walsh’s Office of Policy that researches and tests promising ideas that can move the needle on economic mobility. The Lab focuses on implementing programs at the City level--from work on child care, to children’s savings accounts, to emergency savings. We know, however, that the city operates in a broader policy context. We see it as our responsibility to advocate and build momentum for policy changes at all levels of government and in the private sector. We believe that the blueprint for building a better system starts by centering action on the perspectives of the people who will actually be affected by the policies. Then, it requires an assessment of existing policies and taking actions that: The following bills, key parts of the Mayor’s Legislative Agenda, both eliminate some of what holds families back and expand what works for families with low incomes. We look forward to working with our partners in the Legislature to pass them as essential first steps towards creating a more equitable and resilient City and Commonwealth.As part of our initial research for the Lab, including in-depth interviews with residents, we identified the welfare system as a crucial starting point for improvement. That’s why we led with Lifting the Cap on Kids. The process of working towards a better system begins by rooting out policies that harm children and families.Rooting out those policies has a ripple effect for families and across the economy. Lifting the Cap, for example, supports families in several ways, including providing resources to caregivers. Massachusetts, and Boston in particular, has one of the highest average child care costs in the country. For families, lack of access to child care means that parents may have to turn down a job offer or the chance to accept a higher paying job. Any policies that make it easier for families to access high quality, affordable child care should be a major focus moving forward.For these reasons, one of the Lab’s focus areas, in partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Women’s Advancement, is child care. We are moving forward with projects that will support providers operate child care businesses.An important next step is S.38, An Act to Promote Asset Building for Low-income Residents, sponsored by Senator Sal DiDomenico, which would eliminate the cap on assets for families receiving temporary cash assistance. The current cap acts as a disincentive for low-income families to even think about saving if they believe they may need to access cash assistance.Working with the Legislature, Massachusetts recently raised the asset cap from $2500 to $5000. While this is a positive start, we must continue to make progress. Lifting the asset limit will simplify the application process for the state and eliminate the bad incentive this creates and the message it gives to families that they are not allowed to build assets. Lifting barriers to economic mobility is crucial, but is not sufficient for creating a system that creates pathways to the middle class. We also need to expand what works.When the parents who were receiving cash benefits move off of them, we want to ensure they have the resources they need to achieve economic security. \\xa0That’s why Mayor Walsh supports H.2434/S.1646 An Act Improving the Earned Income Credit for Working Families, filed by Representative Marjorie Decker and Senator James Eldridge, which would raise the Massachusetts Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to 50% of the federal credit, returning money directly to low- and moderate-income families. The EITC provides tax relief to more than 400,000 working individuals and families across the Commonwealth annually.The EITC is widely considered one of the most effective anti-poverty measures for working families. An increase of the state EITC would offer a significant economic boost for low-income workers. The Mayor’s proposal would increase the federal EITC return to more than $420 million for Massachusetts households, up from $126 million in 2014.The City of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are in unique positions to lead on creating policies that\\xa0support\\xa0upward economic mobility and asset building.\\xa0Lifting the Cap on Kids is a great start.

After being selected as an inaugural City of Boston Artist Fellow in 2017, I felt inspired to take risks and make works to match the profound generosity shown to me by the City of Boston.\\xa0The Artist Fellowship Award was the City’s first-ever pilot program designed to invest in the advancement of artists living in Boston. Five artists across various disciplines, including myself, were awarded $10,000 each in the form of an unrestricted grant. The only requirement was that each artist had to collaborate with the City of Boston on a public event that showcased our individual work.I’m a conceptual artist from Roxbury, trained as an architect, who uses architecture as a medium to explore how sensations and emotions may be affected through explorations in material. I form ideas in ink and concrete, exploring artful mistakes made within architectural standards of practice, eliciting unexpected results and poetic experiences from banal aspects of conventional construction.\\xa0An artist can make work in a place, but an artist alone cannot contextualize their work. The Artist Fellowship Award gave me the opportunity to produce a piece of performance art at the Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center at Government Service Center, which was designed by brutalist architect Paul Rudolph.\\xa0Artist Fellow Michelle Fornabai\\xa0during a performance at the Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center at Government Service Center.\\xa0(Courtesy of Anne Piessens)The simple fact that Boston\\'s most vulnerable are placed at the center of government service — quite literally at Government Service Center, which houses the Departments of Labor and Mental Health, as well as 150 resident patients in the health center — to me, demonstrates the beauty of Boston. Brutalist buildings like Rudolph\\'s building and City Hall spoke to me as an artist exploring fragility in concrete — perhaps like many Bostonians, these buildings are known for their bristly exteriors, yet they weather the elements to protect secret, generous and imaginative interiors.\\xa0At the Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center in Government Service Center, I think my \"conceptual act of architecture in concrete\" was constructing a room called the \"Boston Room\" as an art space — for artists, but more importantly for the practitioners and patients who do such truly important and difficult work. Boston\\'s strength is its people and for this performance they were my heart, especially so when I needed to take heart.Artist Michelle Fornabai during performance at\\xa0Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center at Government Service Center, courtesy of Anne PiessensTo speak across the history of concrete in Boston — of béton brut, Brutalist buildings and labors of love — was truly poetic and contextualized my work in an inimitable way. To place my concrete poem in dialogue with what was once described as an “essay in concrete” at Government Service Center was a once in a lifetime opportunity as an artist. It was a profound privilege to have the support of the Mayor\\'s Office of Arts and Culture and assistance at the Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center — coordinating with both the city and state — to realize such a work simply would not have been possible as an individual artist.\\xa0As an individual artist, and an inaugural fellow, I thought a lot about what one artist can do for a city. Upon reflection, I thought to use the placing of my works here in Boston as a kind of foundation, something upon which something else is firmly placed. Artists make possibilities for other artists.In the future, I hope more art and artists will continue to inhabit the \"Boston Room\" and the Chapel — certainly, the most beautiful, secret space to share in Boston. And City Hall\\'s monumental yet minimalist spaces are there to inspire and support the everyday, the every person — to provide an immense space in support of the \"little guy.\" These often overlooked interiors and the Bostonians within them inspired me to be brave in thinking about possibilities for the city and its artists.\\xa0Working with the City of Boston as an artist, extraordinary things can happen in everyday life.The City of Boston is currently accepting applications for its second round of the Artist Fellowship Award.

Walsh together with the Boston Housing Authority and local shelter providers yesterday gathered in Roxbury to announce the release of 1,000 new rental housing vouchers for chronically homeless residents and families in Boston. The vouchers are funded through the federal Housing Choice Voucher Program through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and will increase the BHA\\'s portfolio of vouchers to 13,500.\"I am incredibly proud that through these 1,000 rental housing vouchers we\\'ll be able to provide more residents and families with a home,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"These vouchers are more than a rent subsidy -- they represent a foundation for stability, support and self-sufficiency. We will continue working together to create these homes for our residents and be a city where every single person matters and every single person is cared for.\"Through partnerships with DHD and DHCD and the network of shelter providers and service providers, voucher holders will receive housing search assistance, funds for relocation, and stabilization services for at least six months.\"These vouchers not only help homeless residents and families find permanent affordable housing, they offer them the stability they need to pursue new opportunities and better their lives,\" said BHA Administrator Bill McGonagle.The BHA will issue the 1,000 new vouchers through the Coordinated Access System referral program, the Rapid Rehousing program, the Moving On program, and the Leading the Way Home Program.Rapid Rehousing is a form of supported housing designed to rehouse families who have recently become homeless. Moving On is a program that will assist formerly chronically homeless tenants who currently occupy traditional housing that has supportive services, and are no longer in need of those services, transition to independent housing. The\\xa0\\xa0Coordinated Access System\\xa0was developed under the\\xa0Mayor\\'s Action Plan to End Veteran and Chronic Homelessness\\xa0and prioritizes matching the most vulnerable homeless individuals, including veterans, youth and young adults and long-term chronically homelessness individuals to housing opportunities. Leading the Way Home is a form of supported housing designed to help families transition out of emergency shelters by offering 18 months of supportive services focused on stabilization and self-sufficiency, along with Section 8 rental assistance.In addition to the tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers, the BHA will offer up to 150 project-based vouchers to preserve affordability in developments subsidized through the expiring Mass Housing 13A mortgage program. 13A developments may use these vouchers to help tenants remain in their homes and prevent any risk of homelessness.BHA was able to secure approximately $28 million in additional funding for vouchers this year after they initiated a rent survey and appealed HUD estimates for Fair Market Rent (FMR) in the Boston area last fall. The survey demonstrated the need for a higher FMR, which sets the payment standard housing authorities can set for voucher-subsidized rents, and determines subsidy levels for voucher holders. The previous HUD FMR rate lagged significantly behind the Boston region\\'s rising rental market. The new rate and additional funding will allow BHA to issue at least 1000 new housing vouchers. The BHA last issued new vouchers in late 2017.\"The Section 8 voucher provided me with the ability to find a place for my children and I to call home. With this new stability, I have been able to maintain a decently paying job along with childcare for my children.\" said Paulina Morillo, a voucher holder from Dorchester. \"These vouchers will do the same for many families like mine.\"In addition to today\\'s announcement, Mayor Walsh last week announced his FY20 recommended budget, which includes $4 million to support the creation of approximately 50 new units of permanent supportive housing each year. Creating new permanent supportive housing is a critical component of\\xa0Boston\\'s Way Home, the City\\'s action plan to end veteran and chronic homelessness in Boston.In addition, the FY20 recommended budget includes $1 million to provide connections to employment, rental assistance and supportive services for youth, building on the City\\'s action plan to support young Bostonians experiencing homelessness. These funds will help support early identification and outreach, increase access to effective supports, and develop a collaborative system to create pathways to opportunity for those experiencing homelessness. This investment is in addition to a $4.9 million Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.The FY20 budget proposal also includes a $300,000 investment that will fund four formerly homeless individuals to work as peer navigators across Boston shelters to connect individuals currently experiencing chronic homelessness with permanent housing pathways. Peer housing navigators will help clients with their housing applications, gathering documentation needed for housing, and mentoring others as they transition from homelessness to housing.Earlier this week, Mayor Walsh celebrated a $30 million\\xa0capital investment to revitalize Boston Housing Authority\\'s Bunker Hill Housing development\\xa0in Charlestown, the first time in the City\\'s history that City bond dollars have been invested directly into a BHA project.', \"Boston girls ages 10-18 are invited to BCYF’s Citywide Girls Leadership Summit on Saturday, May 11, at Simmons College, Linda K.

Walsh announced the second phase of expansion of the Boston Public Schools (BPS) My Way Cafe food and nutrition program to 25-30 additional schools in Dorchester and South Boston thanks to a $7.9 million investment in the\\xa0Fiscal Year 2020 - 2024 Capital Plan\\xa0announced by Mayor Walsh yesterday. Today\\'s announcement was made alongside students, teachers, faculty and staff at the Kenny School, which will have a new kitchen built over the summer.My Way Cafe began as a pilot program at four schools in East Boston in the spring of 2017, and since then has expanded to\\xa029\\xa0schools in East Boston, Roxbury, and Mattapan. The neighborhoods were selected based on data showing areas of the city with the highest need for better access to nutritious food. The program has been launched and operated in collaboration with the Shah Family Foundation.\"All young people in Boston deserve access to fresh, and delicious food to make sure they\\'re healthy and able to do well in school,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"My Way Cafe is a program that promotes students making healthy choices and receiving the nutrition they need to help them focus on their education. I am proud that this public-private partnership is making a big difference in the health and food habits of our students across the city.\"Schools are being retrofitted with new kitchens to become My Way Cafes, which provides the ability to cook and serve food on-site for students.\\xa0With two-thirds of Boston\\'s public schools constructed before World War II at a time when students often walked home for lunch, many school buildings do not currently cook food on-site and instead provide prepackaged meals.\"As we begin to modernize our school buildings across the district, the expansion of My Way Cafe provides us a strong investment in our future,\" said Boston School Committee Chairperson Michael Loconto. \"It\\'s important that we continue to plan to support our students in all facets of their school experience, which includes taking care of their basic needs.\"One of the hallmarks of My Way Cafe is that all students have a choice in what type of meal they would like to eat. My Way Cafe offers deconstructed meals, meaning the main ingredients of the meal are separated and students choose which food items they would like on their plate. There are also various options to better reflect students\\' cultures and nutritional requirements.My Way Cafe menu items are tailored to meet the taste buds of young students while using clean labels and natural ingredients. Some\\xa0menu items\\xa0this month include beef and black bean tacos, egg frittata with turkey sausage, and pulled barbecue chicken along with daily offerings of entree-sized salads, turkey and cheese sandwiches, and Sunbutter and jelly sandwiches. \\xa0\"So many of our students rely on school lunch as their only well-rounded meal of the day,\" said BPS Interim Superintendent Laura Perille. \"It\\'s crucial that we are not only providing students the best nutrition possible, but building in healthy eating habits by providing an element of choice.\"Since 2014, BPS has provided meals to all students free of charge.

One of those is our My Neighborhood Resources tool. While it’s a bit old and outdated, the app is still very useful, serving up info for residents based on their addresses. And, it’s well overdue for a Boston.gov makeover.With the help of one of our summer fellows, we were able to do some research into the application and the type of users interested in it. While we had some initial prototypes, we weren’t able to test them as much as we would’ve liked with our users. Before we dove into the technical side of things, we wanted to make sure we were building an application that was easy to use and understand.We decided to leverage our relationship with General Assembly to work with a user experience cohort on prototyping new designs for the app. The blog post below was written by the students about how they prototyped designs for a new version of the app.At our kickoff meeting, the Digital Team asked us to redesign an address search application called My Neighborhood Resources. This application is hosted on the City’s old website, cityofboston.gov. Before the team migrated the tool to the new City website, they wanted to make sure they were creating a user-focused application. The app gives residents information based on a property or location of interest in the City. We felt inspired by the idea of helping thousands of City residents quickly find nearby resources and services on Boston.gov.Our task was to build upon research and testing previously done by a former summer fellow at the City of Boston, and provide some closer-to-final designs. We were specifically asked to think through what information — and how much of that information — should be displayed after an address search.At first, we reviewed the initial research done on the app. To better understand the existing design work and get a baseline for our work, we also analyzed the original My Neighborhood tool. We noticed several areas that needed improvement:Now that we had a better understanding of the common issues users run into with the app, it was time to brainstorm and ideate. At General Assembly, we learned about Design Studio, a method of trying out many design ideas in a very short amount of time. We decided to take that approach with this project.During Design Studio, a team chooses one piece of the design — such as the search bar — and each member of the team has one or two minutes to sketch as many versions of it as they can. Then, one by one, the other members say what they like and do not like (in a nice way!) about each sketch, casting votes for their preferences. The elements with the highest totals are kept, and the others are discarded.For our Design Studio, we considered how two elements should look:To make sure we always keep our users’ needs in focus, we work by the mantra, “I am not my user.” Testing apps with users is essential. We want to make sure they are able to find what they need and receive information when they need it. We never want to assume that our design solution is the right one until we have plenty of users confirm our product is, in fact, easy-to-use.In that spirit, we transferred our designs to InVision. This software is used by designers to create an interactive environment for testers. We may not have all the intricacies of a full-fledged application. But, we can get an idea of how users will engage with that application. In the end, we did six total rounds of user testing with 29 participants.With the test app ready, we hit the streets with our phones to find people who were willing to try it out.On the landing page — where users would need to enter an address — we placed icons for different search categories. We thought these icons would inspire confidence by giving users a sense of what to expect after they entered an address.Users, over and over, tapped the icons instead of entering an address. Since the main action required of users was to enter their address, we needed to more directly lead them to do this. In other words, we had to simplify the design and not create a situation where they needed to think.To make the search field more visible, we decided to delete the icons. After identifying and removing the main obstacle to use the app, we added color to make the app look more like a finished product. By aligning our design with the City of Boston’s brand, we thought users would feel even more willing to use the app.For the next round of testing, we set up ourselves up at City Hall near the Registry and Parking Clerk offices. We waited until residents finished whatever they came to City Hall to do before asking if they would be willing to give us some feedback.If I have low eyesight, italicized text would be a little hard to read.Comment from a userDuring this round of testing, some initial feedback we heard was around folks having trouble reading the text. Obviously, we want this app to be used by as many residents as possible, so accessibility issues were a top priority. To make the text easier to read, we increased the width of the category tab to add space, and changed the type from italics to regular.With our last round of edits made, we went out back out into the community again, this time to the Boston Public Library’s Chinatown branch. We received great feedback from residents dropping off books, or just hanging out on their lunch break.Would be nice if it links to Google Maps or a map in general.Comment from user during testingThroughout our testing, users told us that they expected to see and use maps in the app. At this point, the use of GPS and navigation has become ubiquitous with modern applications. With that in mind, we decided to mark where map links would appear in the search results by highlighting the text in blue.\\xa0Up to this point, we’d taken a mobile-first approach to our designs. It’s a lot easier to work on the kinks on mobile and then transfer that experience to larger screens than vice versa. With many rounds of testing on mobile under our belts, we felt comfortable working on new designs for laptop and desktop screens.The major difference, of course, is that laptop and desktop screens allow more space to be creative with different features. In one sense, this is can be liberating. However, the reflexive decision to just add more can also be dangerous. Too much noise prevents users from getting things done.“I want to jump around the page.”Comment from user during testingWe returned to City Hall one last time for an intensive afternoon of testing. When testing our designs on desktop screens, we noticed users getting “stuck.” When they ended up on a part of the page where they needed to backtrack by scrolling, they often felt trapped. To address this, we added a “sticky” navigation bar at the top of the page. This feature gives users the option to jump from one section to another no matter where they are on the page.Helping to redesign the My Neighborhood app for the City of Boston was an absolute pleasure and privilege for our team. We hope our work helps to make Boston.gov a little easier for its users to navigate, and a little more delightful, too.General Assembly offers accelerated courses for in-demand skills in tech. The students we worked with were part of the Winter 2019 User Experience Design Immersive. Their work on the neighborhood resources application was a final project that they completed over three weeks. We are incredibly grateful for their participation with us, professionalism, and actionable findings. The students who took part in the project were Matt Weston, Elle Troeger, Weinan Li, and Rick Aborn.', 'Boston residents and visitors will soon find it even easier to recycle right, thanks to a new public education campaign and efforts to expand recycling in city parks, households and in public spaces. Boston was recently selected as one of seven U.S. communities to receive a $250,000 grant for a community recycling pilot program from The Coca-Cola Foundation. This grant will support the Fund for Parks and Recreation in Boston and build on the City\\'s ongoing efforts to improve access to recycling and encourage better recycling behaviors through how-to guides, informational materials and signage in multiple languages, website resources and mobile apps.\"When we look at the opportunities we have to reduce waste in Boston, increasing\\xa0education and awareness about trash reduction and proper recycling is a top priority,\" said\\xa0Mayor Martin J. Walsh. \"We are proud to partner with The Coca-Cola Foundation on a\\xa0program that encourages residents and visitors to recycle right and furthers Boston\\'s zero-waste goals.The pilot program will bring recycling bins, signage and collection services to City parks to further expand the reach of recycling services in areas with high foot traffic.The City will soon receive 75 new recycling bins through the Keep America Beautiful/Coca-Cola Public Spaces Recycling Bin Grant Program and will start collecting recyclable items in parks in the Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods this summer. Harambee Park and Franklin Park will be among the first parks that benefit from new recycling infrastructure.\"Our goal is to make it easier for people to recycle when they are out enjoying the\\xa0City\\'s natural resources,\" said Chris Cook, Chief of Environment, Energy and Open Spaces. \"In addition to increasing access to recycling in parks, we are introducing recycling at all special events and creating new Zero Waste guidance for park permit holders. Through this pilot program we\\'re striving to collect at least 50,000 pounds of recyclable material, and in the\\xa0process gather best practices for measurably improving recycling that can be scaled across the City.\"Another goal of the program is to test and learn how to improve recycling in Boston Housing\\xa0Authority properties, in the pilot communities of Dorchester and Mattapan through educational\\xa0efforts and incentives. Focusing on these neighborhoods for new public space and household\\xa0recycling initiatives will enable the City to evaluate techniques and determine the right\\xa0combination of recycling access and education, public space bin placement and other infrastructure improvements that can serve as a model for the rest of the city.\"We hope this recycling pilot in Boston serves as a catalyst to drive increased recycling rates\\xa0and help Boston achieve its ambitious objective of becoming a Zero-Waste city,\" said Helen\\xa0Smith Price, president of The Coca-Cola Foundation. \"The Coca-Cola Foundation places a\\xa0priority on helping communities become more sustainable by supporting innovative recycling solutions at a local level.\"The City of Boston also encourages residents to utilize tools like the City\\'s free \"Trash Day\" app. The app enables Boston residents to search a directory of hundreds of household items to find out the right way to dispose of them while on the go or at home. App users can also view a calendar for their home\\'s collection dates, set reminders and get notifications of schedule changes.Most recently the City launched a new citywide education campaign to encourage residents to\\xa0recycle right. New signage and online materials will help Boston residents better understand what items are acceptable and what cannot be recycled, what kind of containers can be used to recycle, and when events are held for disposing of items like paint and motor oil or hazardous waste. The new campaign builds on the success of the recent \"Bring Your Own Bag\" campaign, which encourages residents to bring reusable bags when shopping in Boston because\\xa0plastic bags are no longer allowed in retail stores. Last year, the City commissioned an advisory committee to develop recommendations for a zero waste plan for Boston and expects that process to be completed soon. The City\\'s progress to date is an important milestone in reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions and becoming carbon neutral by 2050.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Building on his commitment to ensuring long-term prosperity and opportunity in all of Boston\\'s neighborhoods, Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced $2.78 billion in capital investments over the next five years. The\\xa0$2.78 billion FY20-24 Capital Plan\\xa0is how the City makes critical investments in the City\\'s capital assets, including schools, roads, bridges, bike lanes, libraries, and more. This year\\'s plan includes renewed public housing in Charlestown, revitalized parks in Dorchester, transportation improvements in Allston-Brighton, school improvements across the city, and fulfills Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to dedicating over 10 percent of new city funding toward climate resilient projects. This plan ensures the municipal, civic and open space assets that residents cherish in their neighborhoods will remain active and vibrant parts of the community for years to come.\"This budget makes historic investments in public assets like schools, roads, bridges, parks, and libraries,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"This is a budget with a big heart. It reflects our best values: our belief that every single person is worthy of dignity and hope and opportunity. It\\'s going to improve quality of life in all our neighborhoods, and it will continue to generate opportunities for our residents for generations to come. I thank each and every person who helped to guide this vision through Imagine Boston 2030 that has led to these important investments.\"Mayor Walsh\\'s $2.78 billion FY20-24 Capital Plan will make critical investments in the City\\'s infrastructure in every Boston neighborhood, guided by\\xa0Imagine Boston 2030\\xa0and related plans for schools, streets, arts, climate and resilience.This year, under the Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella, an estimated 86 percent of the investments in the FY20-24 Capital Plan are aligned with the City-wide planning efforts. More than 14,000 residents have shaped Imagine Boston 2030 by setting goals for the city by 2030, and generating ideas about policies and investments to help achieve these goals. Together, these initiatives support Boston\\'s dynamic economy and improve the quality of life for residents by encouraging affordability, increasing access to opportunity, promoting a healthy environment, and guiding investment in the public realm.Highlights from Boston\\'s FY20-24 Capital Plan include:EducationMayor Walsh has committed $1 billion over 10 years to bring Boston\\'s school buildings into the 21st century. This capital plan supports that investment with funding for 21st century classrooms, Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) Accelerated Repair Program (ARP) partnerships, completion of ongoing maintenance projects, school kitchen renovations that support the delivery of fresh, nutritious food, and reserves for future projects identified by BuildBPS community engagement. Through a dedication of City capital funds and a strong working relationship with the MSBA, the plan will more than double the capital spending on BPS facilities over the next decade. The FY20-24 Capital Plan will invest $543 million in BPS projects. Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20-24 Capital Plan implements early action BuildBPS initiatives and reserves funding for projects identified by the BuildBPS engagement process.Boston has also successfully ramped up its efforts to leverage MSBA ARP dollars to provide much needed improvements to its schools. This summer, construction will be underway at five schools to replace boilers, roofs and windows. Altogether, these projects represent an investment totaling $14.9 million, with $9.3 million supported by a grant from the MSBA. The Mayor\\'s Capital Plan sets aside an additional $33 million over five years to position Boston to further leverage MSBA ARP dollars in the future.This Capital Plan allows Boston to invest in BPS projects already in the pipeline:The $35.6 million renovation of the Eliot School at 585 Commercial Street will be completed by September.$1 million budgeted for the development of a building program and design for a grade 7-12 school at the McCormack School building.Feasibility studies will begin this year for the Josiah Quincy Upper School (JQUS) and the Carter School projects, in partnership with the MSBA.HousingThe City is investing heavily through a variety of resources in preserving and creating affordable housing. The City is already leveraging other resources like the\\xa0Community Preservation Act\\xa0to support new housing across the City, and Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20-24 Capital Plan is filling the gap created by federal reductions in public housing support. This year\\'s plan provides a $30 million investment to improve the quality of Boston Housing Authority\\'s affordable public housing. This investment in the Boston Housing Authority Charlestown project will preserve and improve hundreds of deeply affordable units in the coming years.Boston is also building on its commitment to expand access to affordable housing opportunities and combating chronic homelessness in Boston. As part of the FY20 operating budget, earlier this month Mayor Walsh announced\\xa0$20.6 million in City funds\\xa0to support housing efforts as part of the Mayor\\'s Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20) operating budget proposal.The City investments to sustain and expand its housing goals represent an increase of approximately $6.4 million, or 45 percent, in the FY20 operating budget for housing over last year. Five million dollars of this investment will be generated by implementing the Commonwealth\\'s new Room Occupancy Excise Law, in accordance with the City\\'s local ordinances. The Department of Neighborhood Development\\'s total budget also includes $64.9 million from external grants and $20.1 million in anticipated spending from the Inclusionary Development Program.Recovery ServicesOver the past six years, Mayor Walsh has consistently increased resources to those facing substance use disorders and in need of addiction supports, including creating the first municipal office dedicated to address addiction and recovery, the Mayor\\'s Office of Recovery Services (ORS). Next year, the City will grow the Office of Recovery Services by 35 percent over its FY19 appropriation so that they can more effectively provide support to those in need of their services. This investment will include new staff, new technology and additional Mobile Sharp pickup improvements. The Mobile Sharps Team, expanded in an FY16 investment, picks up over 50,000 needles a year.The FY20-24 Capital Plan dedicates more than $80 million to rebuild theLong Island Bridge.\\xa0\\xa0The City has also allocated $2 million in funding over the past two years for planning the recovery campus that will be housed on the island.Opened in August 2017,\\xa0\\xa0Bostonâ€™s Engagement Center\\xa0has served as a vital service and lifeline for those suffering from addiction and homelessness. Since August 2017, over 400,000 guests have accessed the Engagement Center. In FY20, the City will continue its work to make the Engagement Center permanent with an investment of nearly $500,000.StreetsThe City has a plan to radically improve the ways, speed and safety of moving around the City. Go Boston 2030 plans a city with streets and sidewalks that are safer, travel that is more reliable and predictable, and quality transportation choices that improve access and interconnect neighborhoods for all modes of travel. To achieve this, the FY20-24 Capital Plan continues to mobilize transformational funding for transportation projects across the City, in addition to its\\xa0\\xa0significant operating budget investments.The FY20-24 Capital Plan makes large scale investments in roads, sidewalks, bike corridors, intersections, bridges, streetlights and other critical infrastructure. This plan embodies the City\\'s commitment to achieve a state of good repair on all major city assets and create a safe, reliable and accessible transportation system for all residents.The plan includes a number of new projects and annual programs, like the reconstruction of the Commonwealth Avenue and Harvard Avenue intersection in Allston and additional funding for the citywide Green Links program. The Commonwealth Avenue intersection will feature plaza space, cycle tracks, and major safety enhancements, while the Green Links program will deliver on the Go Boston 2030 goal to create a connected network of pedestrian and bicycle paths that expand access to the City\\'s green open spaces. Overall, the City will invest $1.2 billion in its capital budget to ensure Boston\\'s streets are safe, accessible, and equitable.Public SafetyEmergency Services:\\xa0The FY20 budget includes another Community Assistance Team and additional resources so that EMS can advance their efforts to hire a diverse workforce. The FY20-24 Capital Plan allocates an additional $375,000 for design and construction of a new EMS garage with staff amenities in the Seaport district. Both investments will allow the City\\'s services to transform and expand as the City\\'s population does the same.Fire:\\xa0The FY20 budget includes a significant technology investment in new equipment, including the replacement of eight fire trucks for a total of 48 over five years, the replacement of bio packs for tunnel rescue and a brush truck which enables the Boston Fire Department (BFD) to respond to woodland fires. These investments will help ensure BFD has the tools it needs to respond when called upon. The budget provides another year of funding for a $500,000 program to enable industrial-level cleaning of firehouses. Reducing cancer risk for firefighters and supporting firefighter health and safety is one of the Mayor\\'s priorities.The FY20-24 Capital Plan will include other health and safety improvements to firehouse projects as a result of recent programming. Starting in FY16, the Fire Department, in conjunction with the Public Facilities Department, studied best practices for firehouse design. Key design changes include defined zones within the firehouse to prevent contamination of living areas, along with improved personal and gear cleaning facilities. The results of this planning are reflected in the replacement of firehouses for Engine 42 in Roxbury and Engine 17 in Dorchester, at a total investment of $48 million.\\xa0In FY20, the study and design phase will start for replacing Engine 3 in the South End and Engine 37 on Huntington Avenue.Environment and Open SpaceThe City is at the forefront of recognizing and addressing the risks of climate change. In 2015, the City created its first climate action plan and during the summer of 2019 will release a new, updated version of the climate action plan. In 2016, the City added a comprehensive climate vulnerability analysis called Climate Ready Boston. Inspired by the Paris Agreement, the City raised its goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 and announced a $2 million investment to protect the City from rising sea levels and $45 million to make municipal buildings more resilient and energy efficient through the Renew Boston Trust. Since 2013, Boston has retained its title as the most \"efficient city in the United States\" as named by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.As part of the FY20 operating and FY20-24 Capital Plan, the City plans to maintain a position of leadership in climate preparedness. In late 2018, Mayor Walsh pledged that 10 percent of new revenue in the capital budget would go toward climate resiliency. In the FY20-24 Capital Plan these include investments in Fort Point -- an investment of $20 million that includes the design and implementation of a signature, climate resilient waterfront park along the Fort Point Channel -- Moakley Park, Climate Ready Boston Harbor and climate resilient investments in parks, open spaces and infrastructure across the City.At Franklin Park, long considered the crown jewel of Frederick Law Olmsted\\'s Emerald Necklace park system, current projects like the Pathways project are complete. Master planning is also underway on the $23 million Franklin Park and $23 million Boston Common revitalization projects.The Moakley Park Master Plan project has also begun and design work will be funded beginning in FY20. This multi-use park will be designed with climate resilience at the forefront so that the entire City will be able to enjoy the park for years to come. At Harambee Park, Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 is underway and Phase 3 will start design during FY20.Overall, the City is investing $313 million in improving parks in 17 neighborhoods.Arts and CultureThrough the FY20-24 Capital Plan, the City will commit $13.4 million to the Percent for Arts program, as this funding will help create more permanent public art in places like the Dudley Branch Library and the new Area A-7 Police Station in East Boston.The FY20 operating budget and FY20-24 Capital Plan significantly invests in construction and capital investments as well as additional books, programming, and community outreach to ensure the strength of local branches throughout Boston.The Library\\'s FY20-24 Capital Plan continues to invest in revitalizing community branches throughout Boston. A number of capital projects will begin in FY20. These include: construction of a new $18.3 million Adams Street Branch Library a $10.2 million renovation project at the Roslindale Branch Library and programming studies for the West End and Codman Square. Additionally, a comprehensive $17.2 million building renovation will be completed at the Dudley Branch Library, a programming study for a new Fields Corner Branch Library will be finalized and a $15.7 million renovation project at the Central Library in Copley Square is underway now, to enhance preservation of historic special collections of rare books and manuscripts.About Imagine Boston 2030Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20 continues to invest in preserving and creating a strong middle class, and creating opportunities for all those who live in Boston.

Walsh joined advocates and residents at Memorial Hall in Charlestown to celebrate more than $11 million\\xa0in Community Preservation Act (CPA) funding awarded to 35 historic preservation projects. After Boston adopted the CPA in 2016, the City created a Community Preservation Fund, which funds affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and public recreation projects.\\xa0\"In Boston, we are proud to be a city of history. When people around the world read about American history, they read about Boston,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Preserving history is not shutting it away somewhere, it\\'s investing in the heart of a community. The three components of the Community Preservation Act -- \\xa0affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation -- connect the past, present, and future of a community. In every one of those projects, we see not only history restored, but communities strengthened.\"\\xa0The Community Preservation Fund is capitalized primarily by a one percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills that began in July 2017. Mayor Walsh and the City\\'s Community Preservation Committee (CPC)\\xa0\\xa0most recently recommended 56 projects from all three categories, totaling more than $34 million, for inclusion in the fall funding round for the Community Preservation Act (CPA). The projects were approved by the City Council last month.\\xa0\"Through investment, policy, and collective will we can maintain the walkable, human-scaled streetscapes that define our neighborhoods, give us a sense of place and identity, and draw millions of visitors, residents, and businesses to our city,\" said Alison Frazee, assistant director of the Boston Preservation Alliance. \"The Community Preservation Act makes this work possible. As the first and only major funding source for historic preservation in the city, we are thrilled to see money going in the door of transformational projects like Memorial Hall.\"\"Thanks to Mayor Walsh and the Community Preservation Committee, we will be able to return Memorial Hall to its former glory and continue to serve the veterans of Charlestown and our community,\" said Joseph Zuffante, president, Abraham Lincoln Post 11 of the Grand Army of the Republic.\\xa0Included in Mayor Walsh\\'s 2019 legislative agenda is \"An Act to Sustain Community Preservation Revenue (H. 2463/S.1618),\" filed by Representative Ann-Margaret Ferrante and Senator Cynthia Stone Creem. The bill would adjust the surcharge on fees for recording deeds to increase the State CPA match, protecting the Act that more than 170 cities and towns depend on for the creation of affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation. When municipalities voted to enact CPA, they did so with the promise of a substantial state match. This year, the match was just 19 percent, meaning that the CPA bill people voted for is no longer the same bill. The Massachusetts House of Representatives\\' proposed FY20 budget includes a meaningful increase in the State\\'s CPA match. Mayor Walsh will continue to advocate for this needed investment throughout the state budget process. \\xa0The following is a complete list of historic preservations projects awarded funds from the Community Preservation Fund in its first year:\\xa0BACK BAYBEACON HILL$500,000 to preserve The Vilna Shul\\'s exterior and make the cultural center accessible.\\xa0BOSTON HARBORBRIGHTON$200,000 for a restoration project that will turn the Charles River Speedway buildings into a gathering space with dining facilities, retail shops, an outdoor plaza, and historic features.CHARLESTOWN$500,000 to restore the exterior of Memorial Hall, a 1791 mansion serving veterans and the larger community, and the home of John Adams\\' Secretary of War.CHINATOWN$290,000 to repair the exterior and prevent water damage in the Chinatown Immigrant Heritage Center at the old Josiah Quincy School, as well as $71,733 to restore the front entrance, stairs, and accessibility for the building.DORCHESTERDOWNTOWNEAST BOSTON$575,000 to restore the Nantucket Lightship, Boston\\'s only floating museum.FENWAY$200,000 to restore the Johnson Gates and Westland Ave entrance paths to the Back Bay FensHYDE PARK$350,000 to repair the roof and exterior masonry features to stop water damage for the First Congregational Church of Hyde Park, now the Hyde Park Seventh-day Adventist Church.MISSION HILL$850,000 to Sociedad Latina to restore exterior features, bay windows, masonry, and roof for 1912 townhouse serving thousands of Latino youth.ROXBURYSOUTH BOSTON$307,000 to restore the gates and fence of St. Augustine\\'s Cemetery.SOUTH ENDWEST END', 'Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) received an application to demolish the residential structure at 64 Baxter Street in South Boston, MA 02127.We will post each Demo Delay\\xa0application to provide the public with information about proposed demolitions as early as possible in the Article 85 process.

Our goal is to meet AA compliance, based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the organization that sets web standards.While we strive to meet that mark — and thought we were — an email that the City’s Disabilities Commission received from a constituent alerted us to the fact that we were falling short when it came to our use of colors. Thanks to some minor tweaks to our pattern library, we were able to create a more accessible experience for our users.We’ve always relied on input from the people who use our digital tools, and this case was no different. A subscriber to the Disabilities Commission newsletter reported having trouble reading links through our newsletter system. When a Disabilities staff member dug deeper, they found that the problem was stemming from our colors and styling. They were not meeting the color contrast ratio set for accessible text.Fortunately, we have our digital branding in a pattern library that guides the styling and colors across our digital tools and Boston.gov. With our design specifications housed in this central location, we knew we could review the necessary changes and consequences more easily. We decided to take a step back and revisit all of the colors used in our brand guidelines to make sure we were meeting our digital accessibility goals.The Digital Team has been fortunate to have a great partner in IDEO. Aside from designing Boston.gov, they’ve also been there for us when we need someone to bounce ideas off of. We put together an impromptu brainstorming session with them to figure out the best way to move forward. We were excited to include industry experts as we worked to resolve this issue.On certain background colors, we just weren’t meeting the minimum standard for color contrast ratios. We found issues with two main colors on the site:They were problematic in certain uses of our secondary colors for text. For example, if we used an Optimistic Blue color on Pale Gray or our Charles River Blue background, it wouldn’t actually provide the level of contrast required.Thanks to some initial research by one of our software engineers, we were able to create a baseline that nearly matched our original colors while meeting AA compliance. The basic idea we came up with was to create light and dark options for everything. Depending on the background-color, we’d switch between the light and dark versions to make text more readable.Our IDEO colleagues helped us put together a color palette on the fly. They broke down all of our options for text color based on our background colors. If you check out our color palette, you’ll see what’s acceptable.We tinkered with our initial new colors until we came up with the options you see above. With our new hex codes, we updated our pattern library to make the changes on Boston.gov. We’re now in the process of updating the rest of our digital tools, including our newsletter system, to make sure they’re also as accessible as possible.One change you should be seeing soon on Boston.gov is an underline for all of our inline text links. Contrast is important, but underlines add another helpful distinguishing factor for those who struggle with colors. We want to make it clear what you can and can’t click on the site. As always, we’ll continue to pay attention to W3C updates and recommendations for web accessibility. If you’re interested in web accessibility, Google has some great guides on best practices.We know we’re not perfect. There’s always going to be something we can make better. That’s true whether it’s design, content, or technology. The important thing is that we keep our eyes and ears open to potential opportunities for improvement and change.

Boston\\'s financial health is strong and will allow us to invest in Boston\\'s long-term prosperity.\"\"The operating budget and capital plan remain rooted in fiscal responsibility and ensure the City remains a good steward of public resources,\" said Justin Sterritt, Boston\\'s Budget Director. \"City departments continue to exhibit responsible spending, cost containment efforts, data-based decision making, proactive fiscal management and long-term planning. The City recently retained its AAA bond rating for the fifth year in a row, and this shared sense of fiscal responsibility will ensure the City maintains that rating into the future.\"While the City has a growing tax revenue base, the City continues to find efficiencies and prioritizes investing in innovative solutions to provide world-class City services. The FY20 budget includes over $24 million in savings from areas like Health Insurance, Energy efficiencies and other operational savings.High-Quality Education for All StudentsThere is no better reflection of Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to equal opportunity than the City\\'s continued strong investment in public education. Over the past six years Boston has grown annual public education spending at the Boston Public Schools (BPS) and charter schools by over $300 million. Boston\\'s most recent\\xa0BPS budget includes $1.139 billion\\xa0to support high-quality education for all BPS students, Boston\\'s largest-ever school budget.This overall level of investment of $1.139 billion is not only at historic levels, but represents a 25 percent increase in per-student funding, up to over $20,000 per year. Next year alone, funding for public education will grow by more than $63 million over FY19. In addition, this investment has come at a time when state aid for public schools has fallen, and 97 percent of our public education investment has come from local revenue.This year, Mayor Walsh continues his strong commitment to creating quality public education for all with a\\xa0$15 million investment in a quality pre-Kindergarten fund. The\\xa0\"Quality Pre-K Fund\"\\xa0will guarantee equitable access to free, high-quality pre-K for all 4-year-olds living in Boston within five years.Investments in education in Boston include:Creating and Preserving Affordable HousingThe FY20 budget includes\\xa0investments towards the production of new housing, preservation of existing affordable housing, and protection of households most at risk. The budget includes funding for the expansion of the\\xa0Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs)\\xa0program by allowing the City to provide no-interest loans for income-eligible homeowners who are interested in carving out space within their homes to create smaller, independent units to rent. This program develops more naturally occurring affordable housing options while creating rental income for homeowners.In an effort to preserve Boston\\'s housing stock while providing economic opportunities for residents and temporary accommodations for visitors,\\xa0Mayor Walsh signed an ordinance in 2018 establishing guidelines to better track and regulate short-term rentals in the City of Boston. In his FY20 budget proposal, Mayor Walsh is allocating new funds to the Boston\\'s Inspectional Services Department for two additional staff members to regulate short-term rentals. These inspectors will assist with the enforcement of the regulations which went into effect on January 1, 2019.The FY20 budget includes funding to expand the\\xa0Intergenerational Homeshare Program. Launched as a pilot in 2017 as a collaboration between the Age Strong Commission and the Mayor\\'s Housing Innovation Lab, the program leverages technology to match older adults with an extra room with a responsible young person looking for affordable rent. In addition, the FY20 budget will fund a housing court navigator to greet and direct families and individuals facing eviction to appropriate onsite services. \\xa0Ending Chronic and Youth HomelessnessMayor Walsh\\'s FY20 budget includes $4 million to support the creation of approximately 50 new units of permanent supportive housing each year, which combines subsidized rental housing with individualized support services so that people can receive the assistance they need to stay housed. It also includes $1 million to provide connections to employment, rental assistance, and supportive services for youth, building on the City\\'s\\xa0action plan to support young Bostonians experiencing homelessness.In addition, the FY20 budget includes an investment that will fund four formerly homeless individuals to work as peer navigators across shelters in Boston connecting individuals currently experiencing chronic homelessness with permanent housing pathways. Peer housing navigators will help clients with their housing applications, gathering documentation needed for housing, and mentoring others as they transition from homelessness to housing.The budget also includes an expansion in outreach services to provide assessment, crisis intervention, and intensive case management services to unsheltered individuals drawn to the spaces and resources of the Boston Public Library (BPL). The proposed new capacity will enable additional interactions at branch locations, which could include the South End, West End, Uphams Corner, and Dudley.Health, Safety and Wellness for a Growing CityMayor Walsh recognizes that a growing city needs to have robust, effective and accountable public safety services and a force reflective of the communities in which it serves. To that end, the FY20 budget includes funds to diversify recruitment efforts at the Boston Police Department (BPD), Boston Fire Department (BFD) and Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The FY20 budget will further invest in BPD\\'s ongoing work in strengthening community relations and prevention programs by supporting the\\xa0new Community Engagement Bureau, funding social workers previously funded by external grants, and growing the size of the police recruit class to 120, taking the City\\'s police force to almost 2,230 officers. The FY20 budget will also continue to fund the police-worn body camera program, first introduced in the FY19 budget with staffing and equipment purchases.In addition, Mayor Walsh is committed to outfitting the Boston Fire Department (BFD) for the 21st century to protect the health and wellness of first responders, and ensure they have the tools they need to fight fires safely. In anticipation of mew authorization under state law, the FY20 budget will fund a new fire cadet class to improve diversity that has proven successful at the Police Department.The FY20 budget includes the addition of another EMS Community Assistance Team or Squad 80 which was first introduced two years ago to reduce ambulance response times. The Community Assistance Team is a non-transport squad who responds to incident call types with low frequency of transport. In its first year of operation, Squad 80 has positively impacted ambulance availability, responding to 2,048 clinical incidents that did not result in a transport and canceling BLS and/or ALS ambulances a total of 442 times, for incidents that did not require patient transport. In addition to freeing up ambulances for Priority 1 calls, the team assists individuals in connecting to city services, including shelters and recovery programs.Building on Mayor Walsh\\'s commitment to providing services for those facing substance use disorder, in FY20 the City will grow the Mayor\\'s Office of Recovery Services by 35 percent so that they can more effectively provide support to those in need of services. This investment will include new staff, new technology and enhanced citywide cleanup efforts. The FY20 budget will allow for the installment of 10 new sharp containers across the City where people can dispose of their used syringes safely.In response to an increase in new HIV diagnoses in the region, Boston will increase prevention and outreach efforts around HIV, hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Efforts include but are not limited to prevention, testing, and community engagement. This City funding is in addition to a $15 million grant the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) received to fund core medical and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS and their families.Protecting our EnvironmentMayor Walsh has been at the forefront of recognizing and addressing the risks of climate change, and protecting our environment. During Mayor Walsh\\'s time in office, Boston has retained its title as the most \"efficient city in the United States,\" as named by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.In 2018, Mayor Walsh pledged that 10 percent of new revenue in the capital budget would go towards climate resilience. In addition to the climate investments being presented in the Capital Plan in the coming weeks, Mayor Walsh in his FY20 budget proposal will invest in additional staff to support Boston\\'s climate plans and goals, including a Climate Preparedness Manager, Building Energy & Resilience Consultant, Archaeology Lab Manager, and more. In addition, the FY20 budget will invest $460,000 to fund initial recommendations of the forthcoming Zero Waste Report that supports the goal of reducing, repairing and reusing all materials in the City. In an effort to increase and improve our tree canopy, the budget also sets aside $100,000 for urban forestry.These investments build on the Mayor\\'s transformative plan,\\xa0Resilient Boston Harbor, that lays out strategies along Boston\\'s 47-mile shoreline to increase access and open space along the waterfront while better protecting the city during a major flooding event.Transforming the Future of MobilityOur economic strength is dependent on our ability to move people around our city to businesses, jobs and homes.Building on Boston\\'s long-term transportation plan,\\xa0Go Boston 2030, the\\xa0FY20 budget utilizes new revenue to make targeted investments in public space and improved mobility, including:Expanding Opportunities for Prosperity and EquityThe citywide resilience strategy aims to ensure every resident can reach their full potential regardless of their background, and to remove the barriers that hinder Bostonians from having access to opportunities. To that end, the City is investing in areas of equity and prosperity.At the Office of Economic Development, the City is investing in $140,000 to support the Boston Economic Development Center, $135,000 to support mobile businesses, with an initial focus on food trucks, and $125,000 in additional resources for the office of Emerging Industries.In addition, the City is investing to promote the\\xa0\\xa02020 U.S. Census\\xa0and ensure every Bostonian is counted. This investment will support Boston\\'s outreach efforts by providing grants to community-based organizations and more support to City departments, in addition to a FY19 investment of dedicated staffing resources. \\xa0The FY20 Budget for the first time includes funds dedicated for the\\xa0Greater Boston Immigrant Defense Fund, a public-private partnership launched by Mayor Walsh in 2017 with the goal of strengthening the Boston\\'s capacity to protect and defend its many immigrant communities, refugees, and temporary status holders, by increasing education and access to legal services. City funds in this years budget are estimated to pay counsel for approximately 30 cases.Investing in Arts and CultureThe City continues to introduce more art into the fabric of city life through groundbreaking investments highlighted in\\xa0Boston Creates, the Mayor\\'s cultural plan for the city. In FY20, the City will invest $200,000 in sustaining key grant making programs for individual artists through the\\xa0Opportunity Fund, the\\xa0Artist Fellowship Award, and an additional $250,000 for the\\xa0Boston Artist in Residence Program, which infuses art into city departments and programs.To support a growing and robust Arts & Culture office, the City will invest operating funds to cover the cost of grants that had expired for the positions of Artist Resource Manager and Communications Director. These investments and the new City-funded grants will create a permanent long-lasting home for arts funding.Building on the robust capital work that has been underway at the Boston Public Library and its branches, the FY20 budget will invest an additional $400,000 to expand access to print and digital resources, expanding access to the material and reducing wait times. In addition to an increase in resources, the Library will increase youth and teen programs by adding additional librarians, and will increase funds for security across the branches.About Imagine Boston 2030Mayor Walsh\\'s FY20 continues to invest in preserving and creating a strong middle class, and creating opportunities for all those who live in Boston.

Walsh today announced the Boston Parks and Recreation Department has launched a new master plan for Franklin Park, Boston\\'s largest park. With sale of Winthrop Square Garage, Mayor Walsh committed $28 million to revitalize Franklin Park, which was designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted and commissioned in the 1890s in response to the challenges associated with increasing urban density. In preparation for this $28 million investment, Boston Parks and Recreation Department is launching a new master plan for the park.\"I\\'m excited to celebrate the master plan of Franklin Park and the renovations that will help Franklin Park reach its full potential as Boston\\'s largest park, and one of our cherished green spaces,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Thanks to the sale of the Winthrop Street Garage, we will have $28 million to invest in preserving and improving this park for our residents, and for future generations to come.\"The plan will provide a vision for the park, building on existing public and private investment and inform the priorities for expenditures from both Winthrop Square funds and future City of Boston Capital Plans. The funds will support capital investments as well as investments in the maintenance and activities of the park.The park is located at the geographic heart of the City, the meeting ground of the Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain neighborhoods. Franklin Park draws visitors from throughout the region and around the world. It is the home of the William Devine Golf Course, the historic Bear Cages, Scarboro Pond, a renowned cross country running course, the Franklin Park Zoo, White Stadium, tot lots and playgrounds, miles of trails, and acres of woods and playing fields.The Parks Department recently completed a six-year, $7.25 million project to improve pathways and entrances in Franklin Park, the largest investment in the park since the golf clubhouse was opened in 1998. That work delivered on the long-term community goals of taking Parks Department maintenance traffic off internal park paths and reestablishing Scarborough Pond as a beautiful and restful feature of the Emerald Necklace.The Franklin Park Coalition has been working as the community voice of the park since the 1970s and hosts park events including the spring Kite & Bike Festival. \\xa0The City and the Coalition worked together to select a unique and dynamic team to facilitate the master planning efforts.\"This is a generational opportunity to protect and enhance the public health benefits of our beloved park, while also developing creative new opportunities in partnership with the Parks and Recreation Department,\" said Franklin Park Coalition executive director Janna Cohen-Rosenthal. \"We were impressed by the selected team\\'s collaborative approach, dedication to the community process, and design expertise.

The short answer is that it is for any constituent who requires language or communications assistance when interacting with the City of Boston. This constituency includes Boston residents, business owners, visitors, students, community members, etc.More specifically, our program focuses on providing meaningful access to two main demographic groups: people who use languages other than English and people who have disabilities. Below is an overview of these demographic groups in Boston as of 2016. To explore City and neighborhood-specific data in more detail, check out our Demographic Data Reports for Language and for Disability.About 37% of Boston’s population uses a language besides English at home. Some are fluent in multiple languages, including English. About 17% say they have some difficulty in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding English. Like any skill, there is a range of proficiencies when it comes to knowing a language. Some people may be in the beginning stages of learning. Others may be fluent but need additional support in specific contexts such as legal or medical situations. It is important to recognize these differences as being unique to the individual and circumstance.The City of Boston supports interpretation and translation for anyone who needs assistance in a language other than English. The top ten most commonly requested language accommodations in Boston are:Our goal is to reduce barriers for people with disabilities that may affect their hearing, speaking, reading, writing, and/or understanding. Increasing communications accessibility includes using supportive technology, adapting the way information is presented and providing services that help people express themselves and understand others.In Boston, there are more than 84,000 people who have a disability. About 22% self-identify as Deaf or have a hearing difficulty, and 21% self-identify as being blind or having a vision difficulty. It is important to recognize that people experience their disability in different ways. A disability can be visible and invisible. It can present several challenges or few challenges to a person’s mobility, independent-living, or communications ability. Furthermore, one person’s disability may have vastly different implications on their livelihood than another person’s experience with the same disability.With this in mind, the City of Boston is working to adopt several standards to increase citywide accessibility for people with disabilities. Specifically, we:We understand that people’s experiences cannot always be simplified to a single label or category. There is a wide range of ways in which someone may experience a language or communication barrier. As such, we are in the midst of a citywide data collection effort to better understand the intersections of language, disability, age, and other details. Learn more about the Language, Disability, and Childcare Survey here (translations available).The best way for us to expand our efforts is to learn from people who would benefit from greater accessibility. We’d love to hear how we are doing, what we can do to improve, or how this kind of accessibility has changed your interactions with the City. You can write to us or submit an anonymous form.Know that your feedback will help shape what we do today and the future direction for years to come.The Office of Language and Communication Access works to strengthen the City of Boston so that services, programs and activities are meaningfully accessible to all constituents.

Walsh today announced his transportation investments in the City of Boston\\'s proposed fiscal year 2020 (FY20) budget and capital plan, with a focus on improving safe, reliable and equitable transportation for all Boston residents. Building on Boston\\'s long-term transportation plan,\\xa0Go Boston 2030, the FY20 budget utilizes new revenue to make targeted investments in public space and improved mobility, including $2 million for bike infrastructure, $4 million to strengthen Boston\\'s Walkable Streets programs, which equitably reconstructs sidewalks throughout Boston, and $8 million to improve the state of good repair on the City\\'s bridges, roads, sidewalks and lane markings.\"Investing in transportation that works for everyone -- whether you walk, bike, take public transportation or drive -- is our key goal as we continue to improve transportation in Boston,\" said Mayor Walsh. \"Creating an equitable city with opportunity for all means ensuring residents can move easily and safely around Boston, and these new investments, from bike lanes to reconstructed sidewalks, will go a long way towards ensuring Boston\\'s streets and spaces safe, reliable and accessible for all.\"The City\\'s investments also include updates to how it manages metered parking spaces and new investments in Boston\\'s streets. The changes in parking management build from the successful two-year\\xa0pilot of performance parking\\xa0in Back Bay and the South Boston Waterfront.\\xa0 Through this pilot, the City adjusted parking meter rates to improve the availability of parking and reduce congestion. Expanding this approach across Boston will not only make parking easier, but also generate additional revenue to improve Boston\\'s transportation network.Boston\\'s performance parking pilot was launched in 2016 and focused on two areas with the highest parking demand in Boston -- the Back Bay and the South Boston Waterfront. Taking a different approach in each neighborhood, the City adjusted meter rates and observed the impact on parking availability. The pricing approach taken in the Back Bay, where the City applied a consistent price over a larger area, showed the most positive results, as double-parking decreased by 14 percent, and illegal parking decreased by an average of 22 percent. During this pilot, on average a parking space was available on every block.Building off of the learnings from this two-year pilot, the City is making a series of updates to its parking meter rates, including:These parking meter changes will go into effect on July 1, 2019. Even with these updates, Boston continues to have some of the lowest parking meter prices in the country, with other municipalities\\' hourly rates at up to $4/hour (Seattle), up to $6.50/hour (San Francisco and Chicago).Residential neighborhoods which do not have parking meters will not see a change.As a result of this improvement, the City expects that the benefits of smarter pricing will also reach these other areas -- it will be easier to find a parking space there will be less illegal parking there will be less double parking all leading to less congestion and lower emissions.With the additional revenue these parking changes bring, Boston will re-invest the funds -- estimated to reach $5 million -- back into creating equitable streets for all.In addition to increased parking meter revenue, Boston is now in its second year of collecting the 10 cent per ride revenue from Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), like Uber and Lyft, which will result in about $3 million in funding available for transportation projects in FY20. In his\\xa0legislative package, Mayor Walsh has also\\xa0proposed further measures\\xa0to encourage shared TNC rides, and reduce congestion in Boston. This TNC revenue will contribute to funding anti-congestion efforts Citywide, as well as safety and public realm improvements.Together, these areas of new investment include:More Equitable Streets:\\xa0The City will increase its investment in both spot repairs of broken sidewalks and the full reconstruction of sidewalks. Strengthening Boston\\'s Walkable Streets Program with a $4 million investment, funding will repair sidewalks throughout the City, including reconstructing corridors near the Orchard Gardens school in Roxbury and the Mather School in Glover\\'s Corner, among many others. This complements the City\\'s additional $200,000 operating investment in an innovative sidewalk repair pilot, which aims to more equitably reduce the backlog and create safer and more walkable streets.$500,000 will be for the installation of four tactical plazas in the public realm that will help revitalize underutilized transportation infrastructure and make streets walkable spaces where people can convene, create, and experiment.\\xa0Boston\\'s\\xa0Tactical Public Realm Guidelines\\xa0focus on making \"tactical\" placemaking more accessible for all our neighborhoods, creating more nimble and standardized processes for the creation of plazas, parklets, outdoor cafes, and street murals along Boston\\'s streets and sidewalks.More Reliable Commutes:\\xa0The City will invest $2.65 million in a series of projects to improve people\\'s commutes. Of this investment, $1 million will go towards accelerating the design and construction of Boston\\'s major bike corridors, including extending bike lanes on Massachusetts Avenue to the Columbia Road and the Columbus Avenue bike lanes north to Downtown Boston. One million dollars will be used to accelerate the expansion of bike share infrastructure to outer neighborhoods in order to improve accessibility and reach the City\\'s goal of 268 stations by 2022.These funds also include $200,000 in additional support for Boston\\'s ongoing bus lane program, including repainting the Washington Street and Essex Street bus lane corridors that serve the Silver Line 4 & Silver Line 5, and investing in a plan for improvements to Blue Hill Avenue.$150,000 will be invested in the redesign of the Massachusetts Avenue intersection north of Melnea Cass Boulevard for safety and traffic improvements, including protected bike infrastructure.$300,000 will be invested in traffic signal prioritization services as part of developing BTD\\'s larger data collection and evaluation strategy. This will help with the strategic utilization of curb space and prioritize traffic signal changes to maximize the movement of commuters throughout the city.Mayor Walsh has also focused the FY20 transportation investments on strengthening Boston\\'s infrastructure, even at a time when federal support for infrastructure projects has weakened. This year\\'s budget includes tripling bridge repair funds, doubling the Walkable Streets project, and expanding the roadway resurfacing work across the city. City-owned bridges are especially important. These vital connections allow people and commerce to move about the city, and replacing or upgrading them keeps Boston moving.Major bridge investments include:For roadway safety, the City will dedicate additional funding to the Vision Zero project as the City aims to construct 15 Neighborhood Slow Streets, complete 15 miles of better bike corridors and fix 15 of the most challenging intersections in the next three years. The City will also continue to increase the investment in a citywide, multi-year campaign to bring all painted crosswalks, lane markings, bike and bus lanes into a state of good repair. Well-marked roads with appropriate insignia help to reduce collisions and make roads safer for all residents.In his speech last month to the Boston Municipal Bureau, Mayor Walsh announced\\xa0new initiatives and investments being made in Boston\\'s transportation infrastructure\\xa0that will help increase safety for all users of the road, ease congestion and provide more viable transportation options for residents, including reducing Boston\\'s speed limit to 20 miles per hour, piloting ride-sharing pick-up/drop-off points, piloting new bus lanes, and providing MBTA passes to all students grades 7-12.These continued investments and initiatives all align with the City\\'s commitment to\\xa0Go Boston 2030, the City of Boston\\'s comprehensive transportation plan to build a safe, equitable and reliable multi-modal transportation network for all users of Boston\\'s streets. To date, action has been taken on more than half of the 58 projects and policies identified in the plan. The investments will further complement Go Boston 2030 efforts that have been achieved to date. \\xa0', 'Building on his commitment to expanding access to affordable housing opportunities and combating chronic homelessness in Boston, Mayor Martin J. Walsh today announced $20.6 million in City funds to support housing efforts as part of the Mayor’s Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20) operating budget proposal. The City investments to sustain and expand its housing goals represent an increase of approximately $6.4 million, or 45 percent, in the FY20 operating budget for housing over last year. Five million dollars of this investment will be generated as part of implementing the Commonwealth’s new Room Occupancy Excise Law and in accordance with the City’s local ordinances. The Department of Neighborhood Development’s total budget also includes $64.9 million from external grants and $20.1 million in anticipated spending from the Inclusionary Development Program.\"Housing affordability remains one of our top priorities in Boston, and I am proud that through our proposed budget we are doubling down on our efforts to create and preserve more affordable housing for residents,\" said Mayor Walsh. “Over the last four years, Boston has built more income-restricted housing than in any similar period on record. Through the new tools and funding in our budget, we will be able to further build upon the progress we have made, and expand our reach to offer more housing options to residents.\"As Boston continues to look for ways to address its housing needs, the City has identified an opportunity to increase its limited revenue and permanently target the funds to enhance housing and homelessness efforts. As part of implementing the Commonwealth’s new Room Occupancy Excise Law, $5 million will be generated through increasing Boston’s Room Occupancy Local Excise Tax by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent for all lodging establishments. In the first year, $4 million will be targeted towards creating 50 new units of permanent supportive housing and $1 million to create pathways for youth and young adults experiencing homelessness.“This budget reflects the Walsh Administration’s continued commitment to identifying additional resources for affordable housing,” said Sheila Dillon, Boston’s Chief of Housing. “It also shows our willingness to explore and fund new ideas to increase the supply of affordable housing and programs that protect the most vulnerable members of our community.”These new investments are in addition to the many other housing investments contained in the Mayor’s FY20 operating budget that target the full spectrum of housing needs in Boston. Departments across the entire City will implement new FY20 investments that will help address homelessness, create and preserve affordable housing, and support homeowners and renters.The following investments target the three priorities outlined in the City’s housing plan Housing a Changing City: production of new housing, preservation of existing affordable housing, and protection of those households most at risk. To accomplish these goals, Mayor Walsh has committed to help create 69,000 new units of housing at a variety of income levels across the City, including nearly 16,000 new units of income-restricted housing that will bring Boston’s total number of income-restricted units to 70,000 by 2030.Ending Chronic and Youth Homelessness Mayor Walsh’s FY20 recommended budget includes $4 million to support the creation of approximately 50 new units of permanent supportive housing each year. Permanent supportive housing combines subsidized rental housing with individualized support services so that people can receive the assistance they need to stay housed. Creating new permanent supportive housing is a critical component of Boston\\'s Way Home, the City\\'s plan to end chronic homelessness. The services are designed to build independent living skills and to connect people with services such as community-based health care, help with mental health issues, substance use counseling, and employment services.By definition, chronically homeless individuals have barriers that create challenges to remaining housed. These barriers can include physical disabilities, substance use disorder, and mental health issues, among others. Without additional assistance, some chronically homeless men and women are not able to maintain their homes. Since the launch of Boston\\'s Way Home, the City has:“Pine Street Inn is extremely pleased to partner with Mayor Walsh and the City of Boston on its commitment to end chronic homelessness,” said Lyndia Downie, president and executive director of Pine Street Inn. ”We know that having a home – a safe, stable place to go every day – can make all the difference in a person’s life. We are very fortunate to have the kind of leadership in Boston that puts its resources behind solving a challenge that affects not just those who are homeless, but all of us who live or work in Boston. Providing housing with support services is not just the “right” thing to do – it is also cost-effective, saving over $10,000 per person/per year on emergency systems.”The FY20 recommended budget also includes $1 million to provide connections to employment, rental assistance, and supportive services for youth, building on the City’s action plan to support young Bostonians experiencing homelessness. These funds will help support early identification and outreach, increase access to effective supports, and to develop a collaborative system to create pathways to opportunity for those experiencing homelessness. This investment is on top of a $4.9 million Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).In addition, the FY20 budget includes a $300,000 investment that will fund four formerly homeless individuals to work as peer navigators across shelters in Boston connecting individuals currently experiencing chronic homelessness with permanent housing pathways. Peer housing navigators will help clients with their housing applications, gathering documentation needed for housing, and mentoring others as they transition from homelessness to housing.The budget also includes a $100,000 expansion in outreach services to provide assessment, crisis intervention, and intensive case management services to unsheltered individuals drawn to the spaces and resources of the Boston Public Library (BPL).Launched in 2017, the current program, in which a full-time outreach worker is embedded at the BPL’s Central Library in Copley Square, comprises, on average, approximately 126 unique client interactions per month. These interactions, which include placements in housing and treatment programs, are expected to double with the additional capacity provided in the FY20 budget. The proposed new capacity will add social work interns to the program, enabling additional interactions at branch locations, which could include the South End, West End, Uphams Corner, and Dudley. Services will also be dispatched to additional locations as needed. \\xa0\\xa0Creating and Preserving Affordable Housing Building and preserving affordable housing continues to be a cornerstone of the Administration’s efforts to address the City’s housing needs. To that end, the recommended FY20 budget includes funding for the expansion of the Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs) program. This $650,000 investment will provide zero-interest loans for income-eligible homeowners. The program allows owner-occupants to carve out space within their homes to create smaller, independent units in East Boston, Mattapan and Jamaica Plain, developing more naturally occurring affordable housing options while creating rental income for homeowners. Since the pilot launched in 2017, 12 ADU permits have been issued, and the City is planning to expand the program to all neighborhoods this spring. No-interest loans of up to $30,000 for income-eligible homeowners will help more owners across Boston create ADUs.Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh and the City\\'s Community Preservation Committee (CPC) allocated more than $18 million from Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds to create and preserve hundreds of units of housing, and to contribute to affordable housing programming like the Acquisition Opportunity Program (AOP) and the Boston Home Center. The AOP provides funding to community development corporations and others to purchase rental housing units from the speculative market and income-restrict them.In an effort to preserve Boston’s housing stock while providing economic opportunities for residents and temporary accommodations for visitors, Mayor Walsh signed an ordinance in 2018 establishing guidelines and regulations to better track and regulate short-term rentals in the City of Boston. The regulations, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, allow for the growth of the home-sharing industry, while including deterrents to prevent operators from monopolizing Boston\\'s housing market with short-term rentals.In his FY20 budget proposal, Mayor Walsh is investing more than $105,000 in the Boston’s Inspectional Services Department for two additional staff members to regulate short-term rentals. These inspectors will assist with the enforcement of the regulations, working to ensure that the owners are abiding by the regulations that classify short-term rental units: limited share unit, home share unit, and owner-adjacent unit.The regulations provide protection for the occupants of the short-term rental unit by prohibiting any property with outstanding housing, sanitary, building, fire or zoning-code violations from being listed. The regulations require the unit to register with the City of Boston each year to verify compliance with the provisions of the ordinance, and pay an annual license fee.Supporting Homeowners and RentersThe FY20 budget includes $100,000 to expand the Intergenerational Homeshare Program. Launched as a pilot in 2017 as a collaboration between the Age Strong Commission and the Mayor’s Housing Innovation Lab, the program leverages technology to match older adults with an extra room with a responsible young person looking for affordable rent. Some agreements even include exchanging basic help with daily living for lower rent. Funding will allow the program to pair 100 matches in FY20 by hiring a vendor to recruit and assist hosts, vet applicants, and provide ongoing support for participants.In addition, the FY20 budget will provide $25,000 to fund a housing court navigator. While there are nonprofit resources available at Housing Court, they are often hard to find and navigate. This effort will fund staff to greet and direct families and individuals facing eviction to appropriate onsite services. \\xa0The City\\'s FY20 budget will be formally released on Wednesday, April 10, 2019, and residents are encouraged to visit budget.boston.gov to find out more information about investments being made in their community.', 'Traffic and parking will be impacted and people coming into the City for the events are encouraged not to drive their personal vehicles. Information on Bluebikes, the regional bike share service, may be found at http://bluebikes.com and information on the MBTA may be found at www.mbta.com. For a faster return trip, the MBTA advises riders to purchase a round-trip rather than a one-way ticket. Walking is also a great way to move around Boston.The Greek Independence Day Parade will begin forming at Noon on Boylston Street from Hereford Street to Fairfield Street on Hereford Street from Newbury Street to Boylston Street and on Gloucester Street from Newbury Street to Boylston Street.\\xa0 The parade will begin at 1 PM on Boylston Street at Fairfield Street with an estimated 5,000 marchers walking on Boylston Street to Charles Street, turning left on Charles Street, and entering the Boston Common for a celebration at the Parkman Bandstand that will end at 4 PM.\\xa0 The formation area is expected to close to traffic at Noon the parade route is expected to close to traffic shortly before 1 PM.\\xa0 During the parade, no traffic will be allowed toward Charles Street from the intersection of Boylston and Tremont Streets, and at the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets all traffic will be directed toward Tremont Street.Doyle’s Road Race will begin at 11 AM on Circuit Drive.\\xa0 An estimated 2,000 runners will proceed to Playstead Road, to the traffic island near White Stadium, and return via Playstead Road, to Circuit Drive, to the footpath over Scarboro Pond, through the Elliot Arch, to Williams Street, ending at Doyle’s.“Tow Zone No Stopping Boston Police Special Event Sunday” temporary parking restrictions will be in effect as follows.Walk MS will begin at 10 AM at Nickerson Field.\\xa0 An estimated 1,500 marchers will proceed to Harry Agganis Way, turn left onto Silber Way, to the Silber Way Overpass to the Charles River Esplanade, cross back over Storrow Drive by footbridge exiting onto Bay State Road, follow footpaths through Marsh Chapel, turn right onto Commonwealth Avenue, right onto Agganis Way, to Nickerson Field.']\n",

It is also one of the factors that make young people think twice about getting married. After getting married, many newlywed couples struggle with meeting the monthly rent and interest rates for housing loans. This is the main social problem that led to the so-called “N-po Generation (a generation giving up a number of essential human activities).” While the average monthly salary has risen by 11% over the last seven years, the average housing cost has risen by 44% in the same period of time. The “escape Seoul phenomenon,” which is driving people out of the city due to housing and childrearing arrangements, is intensifying as well. Among the net population outflow from Seoul (households moving into the city < households moving out of the city), the majority were “people in their 30s with children.”Determined to tackle the housing problem, which essentially concerns the “starting point for young newlywed couples,” the city of Seoul has rolled up its sleeves, and launched housing programs that will support 25,000 couples each year. This means one in two couples getting married in Seoul each year will be able to receive benefits from the city in the form of “financial aid” or a “place in a public rental house.” Any couple who does not own a house and earns a combined income of less than KRW 100 million will be eligible for participation in the programs. The financial aid will be also available to common law marriage’.The key change involves expanded eligibility for the financial support. The housing loan program, which provides up to KRW 200 million for rental or leasing deposits at low interest rates, will be made available to couples whose combined income is less than KRW 100 million, from the current eligibility of KRW 80 million. A couple who earns less than approximately KRW 8 million a month together (KRW 4 million per person) will be eligible for the housing loan program, which includes the majority of workers. The number of recipients will be also increased from 5,000 units to 10,500 units, and the maximum support period will be extended from 8 years to 10 years as well. The “housing supply” program, which provides access to purchased public rental houses and houses near subway stations for the youth, will also be increased by 2,445 to 14,500 units a year (12,000 units →14,500 units). In particular, with the aim of providing prime residence for young newlywed couples, Seoul plans to target houses near major subway stations and places with easy access to public transportation for the program.In addition, in order to prevent cases in which the youth miss opportunities to receive support due to a lack of access to the various housing policies and programs, Seoul will also open an online portal, “Seoul Housing Portal,” at the end of November. The online portal will offer a one-stop service, including a self-check service through which married couples will be able to identify the best housing support program that suits their situation, online consultation services, and application. In addition, starting from next year, newlywed housing support coordinators will be positioned in each housing welfare center in the 25 self-governing districts.\\nDetermined to tackle the housing problem for young married couples with vigor and determination, the city of Seoul has radically increased its investment budget by KRW 2.0849 trillion (monthly average of KRW 694.9 billion) from the original plan. Starting from next year, a total of KRW 3.106 trillion will be invested over the course of three years (from 2020 to 2022). On the 28th, Mayor Park Won-soon of Seoul, announced “Seoul Metropolitan City’s Plan for Housing Support Programs for Newlywed Couples” with these contents. The programs include 4 major changes, which include ① expansion of financial aid and relaxation of eligibility conditions (an annual average of 5,000 units → 10,500 units), ② increase in volume of public housing supplies (an annual average of 12,000 units →14,500 units), ③ support for moving into bigger houses with the birth of a child for couples living in a purchased public rental house, and ④ an increase in accessibility to information on the housing support programs.Seoul announced that it established such programs to ensure that every member of the future generation has a fair starting point, following the increased youth allowance and monthly rent support program for the youth. The vision behind such support programs are that as newlywed couples stably settle down in the city, they will vitalize the local economy and, furthermore, create a virtuous cycle of future growth engines for Seoul. The Mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, said, “These plans are support programs designed to ensure a fair starting point for all newlywed couples in line with the increased youth allowance and the monthly housing rent subsidies for the youth. We prepared these programs by listening closely to the voices of young people to offer practical benefits that they want to receive. We will make sure housing issues do not pose a handicap for newlywed couples who are starting a new chapter of their lives with a dream of brighter future. Through these plans, most workers will be included as potential beneficiaries for the programs. We will continue to develop additional plans.” ', 'The young people of Seoul are on the move to tackle inequality, guarantee equal opportunities for a fair start, and prepare the agenda for the future.

The “Youth Academy” is an academic event that is going to be held on October 31, and from November 2 to 3, 2019, where young researchers proactively discuss youth-related issues. This year, the opening session will be held on the topic of “Generational Inequality and Youth Politics.” Young researchers will hold discussions on a vast range of topics from macroscopic subjects, including youth discussions, youth politics, and youth policy governance, to issues closely related to young people’s lives such as housing policies for the young, youth allowances, and more.The “Youth Activity Fair” will be held on November 2, 2019 to provide an opportunity for the public to meet the future agenda and policies for the youth. About 40 booths will be opened at the fair to exhibit the future agenda, such as problems related to new labor and marine pollution, conduct surveys, and run campaigns on the topics of housing problems for the youth, family members, workplace bullying, and more.Under the slogan, “When our eyes meet,” Seoul Youth Week 2019 focuses on young people’s perception of the world and society’s perception of the youth. The event is expected to become a place where different generations can mingle and contemplate youth policies together.
